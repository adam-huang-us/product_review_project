0,B00JN9EP6E,Alanamous,5,Perfect cover-up for the poop eating pup!,6/1/19,"My pup is one of those dogs who has the nasty habit of eating poop. If I don't monitor her then she will eat her own and  her sister's feces as well. Plus, both of my pups love to eat the cat and possum poop that gets burried under the mulch along the sidewalks late at night while the rest of the neighborhood sleeps soundly and unsuspectingly. My pups will yank me off course the second they smell the pungent poop de possum, burrying their noses in the dirt and slurping it up before I am able to react. DISGUSTING!!!!Lucky for me, awhile ago a friend accidentally had one of her orders from Chewy shipped to me. We got everything straightened out and sent her a new box, but I got to keep the box sent to me and I shared some of the goodies with a local rescue too. Anyways, among the goodies she had ordered were these Twistix Yogurt Chew Treats. She had ordered both the banana and mint flavors. I gave one to each of my sweet puppies, at a time when they were behaving, and I noticed how wonderful it made their breath smell. Surprisingly enough, my doggy doo doo eater normally has pretty good breath, however my other pup has pretty disgusting breath from licking her anal glands. Poop pup.Well, the next time Poopy Puppy managed to snag herself a disgusting snack I decided she needed to floss her teeth with a Twistix Yogurt and Banana Dental Chew treat. Boy am I glad I gave her one! It did the trick of cleaning out the nasty particles that I could see clinging to her back teeth when she had flashed me a big, toothy grin and I easily caught a waft of her sewage breath. But after the Twistix I wasn't as paranoid about her stealing one of my pillows off of the couch or doing something equally appalling.I know I chose to live with this disgusting monster, and I definitely love her. But I'm truly thankful to have discovered something that helps make the difficult parts much more bearable. Because it's no fun to think the best thing in your life is unbearable in the slightest.",Positive

2,B00JN9EP6E,Lola's Mommy,4,Excellent product but WAY overpriced for some reason,4/19/18,"I took a star off because for some reason the price recently jumped from $4 to $12. Last time this happened was because of repackaging so fingers crossed it goes back down again soon. That said, my dog absolutely loves these and has been eating one of these a day since she was a puppy. She has a severe underbite and her bottom teeth stick out no matter what, but our vet is always shocked those teeth are in perfect condition. As a puppy they told us we might have to remove those teeth in a year or two because they’re constantly out and would rot, but we’re almost to 9 years & the vet said to keep doing what we’re doing because those teeth are in great condition!",Neutral
3,B00JN9EP6E,Karen Taylor,5,No more poop breath!!!,3/10/23,"My pup's breath smelled like poop, as if he ate some. I tried brushing and Dentastix but neither helped. After ne pack of these, his breath doesn't smell like poop anymore! I give him one after every meal, since certain foods will cause his breath to be extra stinky. Will definitely be buying more in the future.",Positive

9,B00JN9EP6E,Kp,5,I was worried about these treats when I first took them out of the bag because they're hard like chalk and my dog is 13 years ol,2/8/16,"My Yorkie loves these treats. I was worried about these treats when I first took them out of the bag because they're hard like chalk and my dog is 13 years old. She didn't like them right away but after she started to spend some time on them, they started to dissolve and she could chew on them more easily. These treats are great for distracting dogs but you also have to be careful if they're a smaller dog because the treat is really hard and I could see it could cause choking in over ambitious dogs that don't take the time to break down the treat. The only flaw in these treats is that my dog has a beard and these treats get really milky and foamy and once she finishes her treat it looks like she has rabies and that she's foaming at the mouth. I always find chunks of unfinished twistix dental chews melted to her beard with foam. She loves them so much and they're good for her teeth so I can't complain. I just have to clean her up every time after she's had one of these treats.",Positive
10,B00JN9EP6E,DB's Treasures on Mercari,4,Dogs liked these dental stick!,9/27/21,"My 3 dogs enjoyed these dental sticks, even my picky dog, but I'll probably not buy them again because with having 3 dogs I need bulk... So if they ever offer a bulk of 100+ dental sticks at a decent discounted price per piece then I'm on board!",Positive
11,B00JN9EP6E,Samantha dolan,4,Dog breath saver,4/5/21,My 20 pound dog loves these. I give her one early in the day and one later in the day after dinner and they really seem to be helping with her bad breath. They are the first ones we’ve gotten that actually smell minty.,Positive
12,B00JN9EP6E,R. A. Hentz,5,Dogs love ‘em & Mom feels good serving them!,2/12/20,"This is probably my 75th bag of this product!  While I haven’t personally tasted them, my doggos go nutso for these. They love all of the Twistix flavors, but I think this is their fave (or it would be mine if I could eat them!).  As their fur-mommy, I love these bc they’re Made in the USA, with high-quality ingredients!  They are a little higher in calories, but my boys are small, so I buy the large size stix & cut them into thirds!!  Less calories and I get more out of the bag!!  Great purchase!",Positive
13,B00JN9EP6E,NNS,5,Girls love them!!,11/6/17,"My girls LOVE these! Bonus, their breath smells great after I give them one. I wish there was a smaller size, I have to cut a half inch or so off the ones I give to buy 5lb dog. They take a long time to chew through, but my 6lb dog gets done with hers, before the 5lb one gets done with the one I made shorter.She then runs to get the other one, and of course the little one doesn't want that so she tries to eat it as quick as possible. That's why I make it smaller. I don't want her to choke.",Positive
14,B00JN9EP6E,Suz,4,Best product we've tried so far,7/22/17,"They actually help reduce dog breath! Best product we've tried so far. Surprisingly enough (with mint and vanilla flavor) they are my dog's favorite too - he'll do anything for them. The only drawback - the treats are large (even for my large dog - pictured) and seem pretty rich. I'd typically break them and feed half per day but they are more than difficult to break. Since they're so big, and with so few in the bag, i feed every other day.",Positive
15,B00JN9EP6E,Sharon,5,My dog's MOST favorite chew treat!,1/3/18,"My dog's MOST favorite chew treat. He is a 10 lb Jack Russell mix with Chihuhua. He is a very picky eater and I cook his food, all special made for him. He loves the taste of these and although it doesn't last but 10-15 min, he feels very rewarded with this very special "" treat toy"". We call them twisty toys, and he knows the word very well. I throw it up in air, and he catches it. Then he precedes with a throwing and catching game by himself, throwing in air and catching it, then chewing it. Great price too!",Positive
16,B00JN9EP6E,**SPOILER ALERT**,5,One of my dog's favorites,12/9/20,"My dog loves these. This and the milk & cheese flavor are her favorites... the banana & yogurt, not so much. I have a min pin and even though I get the small I try not to give her an entire one. Usually, when I first open the bag, they are soft enough to cut through a little and break in half.",Positive
17,B00JN9EP6E,Kathryne A.,5,My dog cannot get enough!,6/11/16,"My dog ( american cocker spaniel) loves these things! Brushing his teeth can get tiresome, so these treats truly helps. I always oberseved him when I give him this treat because I am concerned about him choking on it. He usually takes the treat, runs, and eats it at his little hiding place. He places it between his paws, and just chews at it. I never heard him choke or cough it up, so I can say it looks pretty safe for him to eat and enjoy!He usually eats one stick under 2 minutes, and then goes looking for some more!",Positive

My kids will make a fuss when asked to give dental treats to the pupper if it isn't a twistix brand. these have a very subtle smell to them, which is nothing, compared to the odor emitted by some of the other dental treats. I'm in search of an economy pack now.",Positive
22,B00JN9EP6E,Hayley Barnett,5,Great for a quick treat,3/27/21,"My dog loved these but they last about two seconds! I have a smarty pants dog so he needs things to keep him occupied. These definitely don’t last long, but he loved the taste. Don’t leave residue either.",Positive

24,B00JN9EP6E,Hannah L. Butcher,4,Nice for a bit of change,2/24/17,"My fur baby doesn't mind these, but prefers the greenies that she is used to.

I was a little scared of them at the beginning because they are hard, but her teeth are strong so she can handle them and totally enjoys them. I can't get them anywhere where I live so I truly hope Amazon never runs out or stops selling them.",Positive
26,B00JN9EP6E,M. Downey,5,My Dog Loves These and I Like The Scent Too,5/24/17,"Even though my dog weighs 50 pounds and is a big chewer, I chose to get the smaller Twistix.  She gets one every night at bed time.  I hold onto it while she gnaws off the first 3 bites of it, then I give the last piece from my hand.  She loves them and I like that she's going to sleep for the night with cleaner teeth after eating the chew.",Positive

Maybe bigger dogs wouldn’t have a problem.",Negative

100,B0CDRFBRNY,Sarah,5,So worth it,1/12/24,"My dog is a nervous wreck. She gets herself so worked up that she's just beside herself. These have been great for her as a distraction when she's getting to that point. It's not just the ingredients that make this calming. Gnawing on one of these lets her get some of her nervous energy out in a safe way, and I think it's been very effective. She struggles with separation anxiety and falls apart when I leave, but if I give her one of these first and then sneak out the door she does a lot better. I'd definitely recommend these for any anxious dogs out there!",Positive
101,B0CDRFBRNY,Tara Lang,4,Good treats,12/1/23,"My dogs loved these just as much as the popular brand of dog dental treats. They are much more firm by my feel, but they chewed them up fine. I have an Australian shepherd and a beagle. I was worried about the beagle swallowing it whole, but she chewed it well.I did not notice a difference in their energy levels- my Aussie is very energetic and my 13 year old Beagle has high anxiety. Maybe with more use I would notice a change.I'm not a fan of the smell, but it's not terrible. Just weird. Like perfumed beef jerky.",Positive
102,B0CDRFBRNY,Wesley,5,Healthy and my dogs love them,12/29/23,"These are great chews. The ingredients are natural and healthy, and my dogs really love them.Potatoes are the first ingredient, and there are a number of calming ingredients like chamomile, hops, passion flower, lemon balm, and lavender.They really do seem to calm my dogs down after around 20 minutes of chewing.  But I wish they told you the amount of active ingredients; you have no way of knowing the dosage of herbs in a product like this without that information.Still, the quality is very good and my dogs like them so I'm satisfied.Overall - good quality calming chews for dogs, but probably not the most effective calming treats out there.",Positive
103,B0CDRFBRNY,Kimberly Trujillo,5,Travel aid,11/30/23,"We take our animals on vacation with us and we do all we can to make sure that they are safe and comfortable when we rent a house we will turn a room into an animal calm safe space to put them when we need to go out we know they are in a new environment and weirded out to be left alone so we want to make them as comfortable as possible. We bring their blankets white noise machines, all of their toys and their special treats that they only get on special occasions or traveling when we laughed and gave one of these to the dogs we let her start eating it before we left the house completely and she still had her eyes on us she looked like she was just really into the flavor. We laughed and went outside to peek through the window, just to see how it was since we finally left, she just seemed to calmly enjoy her treat , when we got home, she and the cat were both napping together it didn’t look like the cat had jumped around and disturbed too much or that the dog had really done anything either. It was very nice to come in to that pleasant relaxing site of them instead of seeing signs of distress and them scratching and whining at the door as soon as they heard us coming in",Positive
104,B0CDRFBRNY,Amazon Customer,3,Not very calming,12/26/23,"I didn't notice a difference in behavior. As a dental chew, it only lasted maybe 30 seconds, but I have a very aggressive chewer. Overall, these didn't work as expected, but my dog still enjoyed them.",Neutral
105,B0CDRFBRNY,D.p.B.,5,Chewies that my dogs enjoy,11/9/23,"My dogs really like these dark colored chew sticks and will keep them busy for about 5 minutes.  These are supposedly chicken flavor and upon opening the bag, you get the scent of chicken bouillon and original Pringles potato chips.  I would surmise that they are definitely flavored like chicken and that my dogs seem to really like them.  The dark color of the sick does not seem to stain light carpet, but if you have a dog that likes to lick and moisten the treat before eating it then that may be a different story, however neither their teeth nor tongue were stained after eating these treats.  I can't say how well they clean teeth or freshen breath, but since the sticks are pleasantly scented, they don't seem to contribute to foul smelling breath.  These sticks are about the right size for small and medium sized dogs, however any size dog would probably like these treats.  If you are looking for a chew treat for your dog that actually has chicken scent, these are it.",Positive
106,B0CDRFBRNY,Jamie Arehart,4,Good!,11/19/23,"I would not recommend for senior dogs due to teeth and chewing. These dental sticks are pretty hard to bite into and not that easy to break up.Once I got one cut up for him and he ate it, he seemed to be calmer throughout the day and he did not seem to mind the taste.I do not recommend these for dogs with any kind of dental issues. These are a hard chew.",Neutral

108,B0CDRFBRNY,Jennifer Lombardo,4,Half a Stick for Three Pound Puppy,11/6/23,Our new toy poodle thought he had stolen a treat when we dropped it on the floor for him.  He quickly took it back to his bed and chewed all day.  We only gave him half a stick since he is three pounds.  I am thankful for a product like this as it is a nightmare to try and brush his teeth.  I took off one star since he wasn't totally in love with the flavor like some bones I had given him.,Positive

112,B0CDRFBRNY,Amanda,5,Dogs Love Them!,11/10/23,"I didn't think these smelled very good, but my dogs disagree wholeheartedly.  They came running when I opened the bag, and all five wanted their sample.  Even my old girl who's been under the weather wanted to eat these.  I did have to break it up into little bites for her, but the other dogs had no problem chewing and eating them.  As far as having calming properties, I didn't really see much evidence of that, but my dogs don't tend to be really high strung anyway.  My old lady has anxiety and she does seem a little calmer, but she's also under the weather.  I'm just glad she wanted to eat something!",Positive
113,B0CDRFBRNY,TheBeesKnees,5,dogs love,11/6/23,"More firm/solid/hard than other dental sticks I've given the dogs. That is encouraging since it requires more chewing and a better chance of it knocking plaque off.The dogs liked these and ate theirs in a couple of minutes. I gave it near the end of the day. Neither dog was super active nor had the zoomies before hand, but now both are laying on the couch relaxing, one is even snoring. I'd say they are relaxed.I'm not sure this would calm a dog that is already hyped up, but in the same way a cup of tea won't help an angry human, but it can make nighttime even more relaxing, I look forward to helping the boys wind down for the night with a calming treat.",Positive

I gave them to my two Pitbulls and my stepdaughter’s Aussiedoodle and they were able to eat these treats easily within just a couple of minutes. They seemed to really enjoy them. However, these treats are a bit too big and hard for my Pomeranian to eat. I can’t say they calmed the down much though.",Positive

She has started getting tired of many of the treats I usually get her. When I opened this package she came running. She has been eating these for several nights and is still in love with them. She's 60lbs and these are a good size for her,  so if you have smaller dogs you might want to break these into smaller pieces.",Positive

However, I gave them a shot with my pets and I was 1/2 in terms of them liking it. One would not touch it at all and the other was fine chewing on it and ate it pretty fast.Again, idk if the super dark color is normal, but I'm watching closely my pets after they eat this. In terms of ""Calming"" them idk if it has much impact to be hones, but I only started with a half stick. I can't give this a great review, nor is it a bad one so leaving this as 3 stars.",Neutral

These are a soft chew and don't give off a lot of mess on your hands or your pocket and they're small enough that they are a good reward without taking too long for them to chomp down before the next repetition.I think for the price and the quality these are a great treat to keep your little ones focused on the task at hand an learning.",Positive

Not sure if this is how the product is supposed to be or not or if this is just old treats. The best by date is September 23 but it doesn’t say when it was manufactured. I feel like I’m being sent old almost expired products so they can clear inventory. I would think companies would want to send out the best product so that customers will keep coming to buy. This kind of product being sent creates a 1 time purchase and never again. I’m additionally both cats just looked at it and walked away. Mind you these cats when they see a treat they never say no.

Woody,4,one out of three cats will eat these but that is the one who I needed to and these have helped him,11/28/21,"So the 2 year old healthy cat won't touch these, the five year old fat cat ate these once then wouldn't eat them again.  The 4 month old stray we adopted over a month ago who is having a hard time kicking a pretty bad kitty herpes flare loves these and he is the one who I needed these for.  We have been giving him 500mg lysine twice a day as the vet directed and keeping him on antibiotics to prevent a bacterial side infection in his lungs, but he has not been getting any better.  Within two days of giving him these he has less rattling in his lungs, this has been the only improvement in his condition we have seen in over a month.  I did the math and for 6 chews there is only about 70mg of lysine, and since we have been giving him high doses of lysine for over a month the lysine is obviously not the ingredient in these chews that is helping.  I am therefore left to assume it is the probiotic.  While he is still far from recovered this has given me hope and I am going to look into a more broad spectrum probiotic and see if we can get him over this flare and onto a preventive regime which I think these chews will make be a part of.",Positive
243,B09FQ9VZNP,ChiefB & SweetieBoo,3,My Cat Thumbs His Nose At This,11/28/21,"Every cat is an individual, and they know what they like and what they don't. Although many cats seem to love these Biteables, my senior cat would have nothing to do with it. I tried a single treat whole, then broken in half, and he just sniffed it and walked away each time. The next morning I even broke one in half and hid it in the middle of his wet cat food, which he normally inhales the minute I put it in his bowl. He ate around the treat halves and left them in his otherwise empty bowl. He loves chicken, which is the primary ingredient in these treats, but apparently that wasn't enough to entice him. In people years my cat is 88 years old, so it's not like he's going to change his food preferences at this stage of his life. The ""chicken and tuna recipe"" on the package is a bit misleading, since the tuna is only ""natural tuna flavor"" and not the real deal, and the same with the ""natural fish flavor."" I am still rating this product 3 stars even though my cat didn't like it because I think the L-lysine, taurine, and probiotics probably would have been good for him if he had been willing to eat these treats.",Negative
244,B09FQ9VZNP,Cathy,3,Soft treats for your cst,10/24/21,So I was really hoping our cats would love these soft treats so I could feel good about giving treats that had some health value to them. Unfortunately only 1 of our 3 cats would remotely touch them and it was only once.  I’m sure it’s just that our cats are picky about their food and treats.  They seems to be good quality with good packaging. Our cats just prefer the junky treats to the healthy ones. Go figure.,Negative
245,B09FQ9VZNP,Joe Smart,2,Both of my cats hate the flavor,10/30/21,"Different cats have different tastes so normally I wouldn't give a product two stars just because my cats didn't like the flavor but I really think it's warranted and possibly even generous in the case of Get Naked Essential Health Biteables because both of my cats really love treats but they absolutely hate these.The package boasts that Get Naked Biteables provide essential health benefits including lysine and probiotics and that the #1 ingredient is real chicken--although that last one doesn't actually mean anything because they could be saying that the highest quality or most expensive ingredient is chicken, not necessarily that chicken makes up the largest actual portion.  In any case, these are not cat food--they are cat treats.  With cat food, strong health benefits are definitely something you want to look for but with treats the number one most important thing is flavor.  Cats should be thrilled when you pull out the package and they see that you are about to give them a treat.I have two cats.  They both love treats.  They both ate exactly one of these Get Naked Bitables treats and will not touch them again.  They absolutely hate the flavor which means these aren't much of a treat as far as my cats are concerned.  Get Naked Biteables might well be very nutritious but they neglected the single most important thing that every cat treat needs which is great taste.",Negative
246,B09FQ9VZNP,GK5040,4,A treat that is more like a vitamin!,10/25/21,"Our Siamese kitten is kind of picky about her food yet she loved these soft heart shaped chewable cat treats. They are made in the USA, and chicken is the first ingredient, however they smell more fishlike.  These treats are more than a treat, they are a probiotic containing Lysine which is an essential amino acid helps pets produce antibodies and enzymes that support immune systems.  It is also helpful for calcium absorption which supports strong bones and promotes healthy skin. This is important, so our kitties can fight diseases and have healthy bones. Cats do not make lysine on their own. They must obtain it through their food and supplements.  L-lysine is not for all cats so check with your vet. I do not agree on the dosage. I think these treats should be used sparingly because it can interfere with other medications. The package is small but affordable. I’m feeding our 7 month old cat one a day to support a healthy gut and immune system.",Positive

The other lysine treats I use are one to two a day.  And they aren't as popular.  Though fortunately, the one cat that really needs them also likes them.  And price-wise, they are about the same.However, they do make a joint health treat that I may have to try for my cat with a damaged spine (before I owned him - got him that way from the vet where he was dropped off)  I've yet to find a treat/pill that he will take.",Positive

Lysine can be a good thing to try to help these cats with their symptoms of sneezing and rasping. She loves these Biteables and seems to think they are a treat on par with Temptations, and that is in contrast to other lysine supplements she has quickly lost interest in.Cats with breathing difficulties sometimes also have trouble with their sense of smell, and I suspect the ingredients here such as natural fish and tuna flavors are strong enough (but pleasant to the human nose) to maintain their appeal to a congested kitty. The main ingredients here are chicken, glycerin, sweet potatoes, tapioca starch and L-lysine.These snacks also contains dried Bacillus fermentation product, designed to promulgate digestive health.The manufacturer recommends five to six of these soft treats per day.

However, the Biteables are more than treats. They're a source of good nutrition too! They weren't universally accepted in my household as 3 out of 4 of my cats gobbled the treats down while one refused them. So this may not be for every cat. But given that they're a better alternative to traditional treats, I think they're worth a try. They have a soft texture and seem fresh right out of the resealable package.Made in the USA~ Kort",Positive
251,B09FQ9VZNP,Brenda Marie,5,<3 My kitty LOVES these <3,10/19/21,"My kitty LOVES these treats – like climbing on me to get them!  So, no problem there at all.  My kitty is a big long kitty weighing in at 16 pounds, though.  The directions say to give 5 to 6 treats for cats over 5 pounds.  I am not a scientist but maybe my kitty would rather need like 10 to 15 treats for her weight?  I dunno – I know sometimes it doesn’t work that way.  Either way – 5 to 6 treats every day seems like a lot for my baby.  I don’t give her many treats – and definitely not even every day.  So, for me – these work more of a treat with benefits rather than a supplement.  But to each their own.

I got them for one elderly cat who's stool seemed to be a bit looser then normal on occasion and the vet could find no reason. I thought the probiotic aspect couldn't hurt and might help. I've been giving him the 5 per day as recommended but see no change other than the other cats resent me for not giving them as many, lol. It's only been about a week and a half and I'm running out so I'm not sure if my cat's issue is not probiotic related (probably) or I haven't been giving him these long enough or if that aspect of these is no good.But they all like them as treats so I'm happy.",Positive

This is the longest lasting so far.I get her the largest possible size. She’ll go through a small Nylabone in about 10 mins. This takes her a few hours but more importantly it keeps her attention and satisfies her chewing urge.My frenchie is about 15 pounds at six months old and has most of her adult teeth, they’re still growing in and she needs to sink them into something.Tbh I hesitated about getting such a big bone for my small dog, but it was the right call. Not only does it keep her busy for a while but because it’s so big, it’s stripped her of the urge she started getting with the small bones to swallow them whole as soon as they seems small enough. Now she chews it down to a tiny nub and doesn’t try to swallow it (tho I still grab it and throw it away if I see it).Good bone, do recommend for smaller dog if they are a strong chewer.",Positive

310,B007RW7CJQ,Michelle,3,Caution; Throw Out When It Gets Hard!,4/14/21,"So, I've been getting these for my dog a while now. She normally scarfs them down over the course of an hour, but the latest time, she decided she wanted to keep one end of it to put in her little treat stash. About a week later, she grabbed it, we played fetch with it (it was hard like rock now) and she ate it; I thought nothing of it because it still chewed apart. Later that day, about 12 hours, she threw up a large amount pieces that weren't digesting. Even though they weren't splintering, the pieces were just sitting in her stomach like a bunch of rocks. They were getting smoother and I'm sure still digesting, but they were also causing obvious pain to her and she was unable to eat anything else while they were still clanking around in her stomach.I'd still absolutely recommend these to dog owners, but with much more caution and awareness. Once the texture isn't the soft-ish bendable feel it was out of the bag, its time to toss it. I got lucky she threw them up, and that none of the harder bits did splinter, but its important to be aware of things like intestinal blockages or damage that can occur from treats that appear fine.",Negative

However this time they did agree and the verdict is that they were unimpressed by the flavor of this bone.The size is great. The texture holds up pretty nicely to aggressive chewing. While it doesn’t stain fabric, it does leave a faint residue when wet from slobber. There’s absolutely no smell which is wonderful. The only downside is that my dogs weren’t impressed with the flavor. With that said, I’m hopeful that there are less finicky pups out there who might actually enjoy the product!",Neutral

401,B0175BN7B0,sara,3,Prongs can easily snap off causing choking hazard,1/25/22,Ours fell apart and my dog started to choke on it-it’s like a giant jacks and it can easily be taken apart. I have a Lhasa and a Shih Tzu who are 20lbs/11lbs and not big chewers. My Lhasa barely touched his and one of the prongs came off and we couldn’t get it out of his mouth when he started to choke on the knub he had reduced the broken prong to. Thankfully my teen son was home and between the two of us we got it out of his throat. Really scary stuff. They’re not hard like a yak stick-more of a softer medium and the prongs can easily be snapped.

434,B01JONKIAU,Manatee,5,LOVE,8/17/23,My dog loves these dental chews.  She weighs about 13 pounds so make sure when you order them you get the small size.  She's been enjoying them for years.  She gets it as a treat after dinner.  Even my vet commented on her teeth being in such good shape for a dog her age.,Positive

They are her favorite and she'll do quite a bit to earn one. They seem to satisfy her insatiable chewing problem (at least for a few minutes), and her teeth are sparkly white with very little tartar build up. I like that they have GOOD things inside, not random yucky bits like so many dog treats. We've gone through ten packs of these in various flavors and will continue to buy them for her as long as she continues to love them (we rotate flavors so she doesn't get bored). She seems to like the pink ones the most, but never turns away the other flavors (and she does turn away other brands of dental chews!). They are the ONLY treat that will get her to come back inside the fence when she's escaped, as well.",Positive

However, when I receivedmy latest bags, I could not even cut through them with a sharp knife.  I always cut them into severalpieces, and sometimes they were a little hard and I just splashed into the bag with a little water andsealed it up again, and then they had softened up enough to cut.  The sticks in this latest shipmentwere so hard that I was unable to soften them up, even after several infusions of water into the bag.This is absolutely unacceptable, particularly since they are freshness dated ""by Feb 25, 2025.  Mydentist told me that one of her dogs actually broke a tooth on these dental sticks!!These are supposed to be beneficial for dogs, and not so hard they are dangerous.I am sending the three bags that were in my last shipment to the company, since they are notreturnable to Amazon, but I am disappointed that Amazon is carrying something so obviouslynot up to their standards.I have been purchasing these dental sticks for years for my small Havanese dog.

They get excited even seeing the bag, and are willing to do any number of tricks just to get their paws on one. For me, I love the ingredients and price point.

I like that they were decently priced and you get a fair amount in the bag (about 20 of them). I give my dog two of these a day so wish they were sold in larger quantities. As far as the immune system boost, I can’t confirm it has helped that for him as he had no prior issues. I just know he can’t wait to get these in his belly :)",Positive

We used to buy these several times a month, but they have raised the price drastically since I first started getting them ($3.99 to $8.99 in less than two years) so we have stopped buying them as often.

The price is also a reason that I continue to buy this brand. But for the past two or three months every time that I receive my order the treats are completely smashed. It's like dust in the bottom of the bag. Very few are still full size. It's very disappointing.

These used to be soft, waxy, fatty treats. Now there mostly dust and crumble with the slightest pressure. One of my ferrets won't eat them and shows no interest (but usually loves these) and I don't really feel comfortable feeding them to either because they look expired or poorly formulated. I don't know what happened. These are available with the usual consistency through Petco. Additionally, Amazon/seller won't accept return or replacement of this item in particular.

549,B014KLSBDW,FGC,1,Bacon Flavor in Chicken Packages,10/29/22,"I have purchased these many times as my ferret loves their chicken flavor treats. Oddly though, the last time I purchased 2 bags of the chicken flavor ones they looked darker, almost black. My ferret would not eat them. I already purchased the bacon flavor for him awhile ago and he would not eat those either. In the provided picture, the first bag (left) are the chicken ones I am referring to that I just bought and he won't eat. The bag in the middle is my last ""good"" ones I bought and the last time they shipped the ones he loved. Note that these are way lighter in color than the ones on the left. The bag on the right are the bacon ones he won't eat. So, in conclusion, the chicken bag ones on the left look exactly like the bacon ones in the bag on the right. I think they may have put the bacon flavor ones in the chicken bags by mistake. Now I am afraid to order more as I can't be sure they will be correctly packaged and Amazon will not accept returns for them. If you know ferrets, they can be very fussy regarding food and treats so I hope someone that can do something to fix this problem will see this review!",Negative

He's not food motivated at all and has been super accepting of his diet that includes free feeding good quality kibble with canned offered instead a few days a week. He definitely loves and wants that canned food but even then, never really eats with gusto. I say all this to explain that he just doesn't get all that excited over any food, but he does enjoy these treats.They are rather large, at least 5x the size of a single piece of kitten kibble, but no problem, because breaking these treats up is easy and makes treat time last a little longer.I also worried that these treats would arrive all smashed and broken as some reviewers have experienced, but that wasn't the case here.

Thankfully we have another cat that thought it was Christmas. 😂She would not eat any of them after looking on Amazon. I had ordered these on a whim. It had everything that I was looking for nutrition wise.I opened up the bag and went to give her one, and she devoured it. I was gobsmacked to say the least.",Positive

The only problem I had with these (and why I rated 4 stars) is that the treats are quite large for a kitten. I have to break them into two or three pieces to feed to her since her mouth is so little right now. They are super easy to break up into smaller pieces, so no issues there, I just wish the treats were a little smaller so I didn’t have to.For size comparison, I showed the treat next to her kitten food (Purina One Plus, healthy kitten formula)",Positive

They absolutely adored these.They’re harder than I thought they’d be, so I wouldn’t recommend for teething kittens. My boys were about 4 months had to work to chew it. As they got older it was a lot easier, so take the age into consideration before ordering.One of them has a very sensitive tummy and this didn’t do much besides give him some terrible smelling poop.

I give them pieces of these purely for healthy bedtime treats. I use kitchen shears to cut the rings into several pieces (each piece about an inch long).Then at bedtime, when my doggies are done eating for the day, they each get one piece. I feel the chewing motion helps clean their teeth and release healthy enzymes in their mouths. I love that the ingredients in these are so healthy and natural.And best of all my pups love their nighttime routine. They go out to potty, then race up on the porch and through the door to get their nightly pumpkin treats. Then time to snuggle with mommy & daddy!Oh, one more thing....once in awhile I get a bag where the rings are extra hard and brittle. When that happens, I just wet a clean paper towel, ring it out, then put it in the bag with the treats. I leave it sealed that way for about 24 hours. After that, they are more pliable and my kitchen shears cut through much better. And they are less brittle for my dogs' teeth that way too.",Positive

790,B00X6THK2S,Tayler,4,A teething must!,6/15/20,"I can't imagine ever going through a teething puppy again without getting these. My Aussie is obsessed with them. They're the perfect texture between chewy and hard to keep her entertained for a good 10 minutes.Our pup always puts her ears back and closes her eyes when her teeth hurt and she's chewing on something that helps it. These help! The fact that they're curved into rings seems to really help her target whichever side of her mouth is hurting.That being said, these rings are HUGE. There are only 6 in a pack because they're so big, and the serving size starts at 1/4 a day?! So what, am I supposed to take the ring away after she's chewed through part of it? I did that and my dog tried to swallow the piece whole and choked on it. I got around that by just cutting the rings into quarter pieces (which takes a little patience).My pup LOVES these, especially the pumpkin, so I foresee getting these for the next few months, even when she's done teething.",Positive

They don't smell like something I imagine a dog would like. But to my surprise she went for it and enjoyed. She didn't finish it in one sitting, but she's also only a mild chewer. I don't think these necessarily helped her breath to smell any better in the long run but it gave her something to chew on for a good amount of time and her breath smelled decent shortly after. I think the ring shape was also fun for her.",Positive

795,B00X6THK2S,Juli m.,5,Great for puppies,6/9/22,These are my little guy’s favorite treats. They helped me get through the teething phase so I would have a break from reprimanding him. They used to take him about 15-20min to get through 1/4 of a ring… Unfortunately he just got all of his adult teeth now he eats half of a ring in about 5 minutes so I’m looking for a more appropriate adult treat to keep him busy now. Ps they smell AMAZING and make your puppy’s breath smell like cinnamon after eating. My guy seems to like the chicken flavor the best but those smell good too,Positive

IT'S really important to be with your pup do NOT put these in a crate or give to them and leave. These do not last very long.  10-15 min at most.I gave him a treat and about 10 minutes in he started acting weird.... pawing at his face, doing weir stuff with his mouth.  I could tell something was wrong and I thought he was choking. Stuck my finger down his throat- didn't feel anything, felt his throat nothing was protruding.  He was distressed.  Was putting on my shoes and grabbing my purse to run to the vet when I grabbed a flashlight- turned him over pried his mouth open and the darn piece was stuck to the roof of his mouth.

She is now 4 months old with most of her adult teeth and can kill it in about 15 minutes, but when she was about 8 weeks old, she would work at it for 1-2 days. They smell great, like a pumpkin pie, and I haven't seen any indication of digestive issues. It makes me feel better knowing there are so many good ingredients and none (if very little) of the crap. I've bought 3 bags now, which is becoming expensive so I may try to make some pumpkin treats myself since she doesn't really need the hardness of these for teething anymore.At first I was worried about her choking when she gets a chunk broken off, but she chews pretty thoroughly before she swallows. Regardless, I always supervise while she's chewing.",Positive

I can’t say how they are for teething exactly because she eats it very quickly, but they are a special treat for her.

Pillows, blankets, shoes, fingers, whatever she gets a hold of I pull Her off and stick the teething ring in her mouth. In three days she has learned what is a good chew and what is a no chew. She loves them. I bought Four more bags. Our older Husky loves them too but they don’t last nearly as long with him.

It calms him an hour afterwards.,,,This occupies my 12 wk puppy for 20-30 minutes until he ferociously finishes it. My arms are saved from being bitten bloody during that time and for awhile after... so price is well worth it. The oils in the chew seem to numb his mouth. I have a high bite drive puppy from police line. Normal puppies could make this last much longer. He loves it far more than antler, bones, or skins (which are less appetizing than arms). It is safe for my dog to go wild on. Perhaps make sure your puppy is smart enough to gag himself should he shove down throat. ?",Positive

They last a decent amount of time with him. The adult dogs want nothing to do with the scent of them, but they are for the puppy anyhow. :)I can only give these a 1 star as I am unable to rate how well they stand up to chewing as the dogs won’t touch these, I believe it’s because of the flavor. Personally they smell delicious, but it’s pretty strong pumpkin smell so maybe it’s off putting to the dogs.",Neutral

She enjoys chewing on them as she is a chewer. I recommend these as the rawhide chews are dangerous for my girl as she likes to stick the whole rawhide chew in her mouth.  NBone chews are the greatest option.,Positive

A welcome change from some treats that smell horrible, if you know what I mean.2) I have two chihuahua puppies who NEVER sit still and who are NEVER quiet. Since giving them each a treat, I have enjoyed a full hour of total silence. They initially went NUTS over the treats, running all over the house waving them around-- then settled in and started chewing. They haven't stopped since. It's worth the asking price just to see them so content!3) The puppies obviously love the flavor. I'm buying more immediately.

Seriously, they smell like cloves and cinnamon and my dog absolutely loves them! I bought them because he's a persistent beggar and I'm a big pushover and since he's already overweight, I needed to find a low calorie treat for him. He eats them pretty fast, so I wish they lasted a little longer. And like all quality dog chews, they're not cheap.

I have bought her dental sticks from Greenies, treats from Blue Buffaloe, and many other treats that most dogs I know love but everytime I offer them to her, she gives me this look like ""Really? You want me to eat that??"" She also doesn't like hard treats or treats that are bigger than a dime. But she'll eat these all by herself and not expect me to make it into smaller pieces! Plus, the ingredients are great and it's made in the USA. Couldn't ask for anything better. It's a chew toy, dental stick, and treat.",Positive

The vet is very pleased at their weight loss, and switching over from higher calorie treats to these Naked Grain sticks has helped immensely. True, they don't last long, but my dogs are 30-40 pounds each, so I didn't expect them to last a long time. A smaller pup might enjoy these for a bit more.

She is allergic to grains, breaking out in hot spots all over her body.  I especially like that there are different kinds to cater to a dog's needs.  She is 6 years old and had her first dental a couple months ago and the vet said her teeth were in ""amazing shape"" especially with her being a poodle mix and poodles tend to have dental issues.  Not only that, her teeth are crooked.  All she required was a cleaning.  I do not brush her teeth but rely solely on this product to remove tarter and keep her teeth cleaned.  Mission accomplished!",Positive

The dogs really liked these and were able to devour them pretty quickly.  They did take slightly longer to chew than a normal dental stick, however.  The ingredients are not super alarming, though I don't think they are quite as good as our usual brand.  If you have a dog over 50 pounds, these are pretty easy to serve.  However, you are supposed to give dogs under 50 pounds less than a full ring a day, and these are rather hard to break.  You may be able to cut them, but I didn't think to try that because I have large dogs, so I am not sure how well that would work.  Each ring is 112 kcals, which is slightly more than the kind we usually use, so I like to give these only occasionally.  The bag does list all of the important information I look for; ingredients, guaranteed analysis, calorie content, feeding guidelines and expiration date. The dogs did not have any adverse reactions to these dental rings.  Though I don't feel this is the healthiest option out there, the dogs really loved them and the treats are not super unhealthy so I will probably keep these on as an occasional option to change up our daily routine.",Positive

Even though the rings were made for adult dogs, they kept my two puppies busy for quite a while and took care of their ""itchy"" teeth; so these are perfect for teething puppies. The dental rings don't have a strong smell like bull pizzle or pig ears, additionally, they are free of many common allergens and the rings did an excellent job of reducing doggie breath, especially my oldest dog's ""guess what I found in the backyard"" breath. These chicken rings are definitely going into our treat rotation.The Bottom Line: The 7-count bag of N-Bone Chicken Flavor Adult Dog Dental Rings sells for $9.88, which is just $1.41 per treat which is less expensive, per treat, than the bulk treats at my LPS.",Positive

These did not cause any upset stomachs.The ingredients of these n-bones are pretty similar to those of Twistix, which I've been giving my dogs for years and years as well as the dogs for whom I dogsit.

However, I can say that my dog absolutely loved these. When we sat the first treat down, we weren't sure what to expect, bc he can be picky about treats. Our expectation was that he would take a few minutes to gnaw on the treat or he wouldn't eat it at all. To our surprise, he almost inhaled the whole thing...and he did that every time he got one.

They are on the large side and keep her occupied for a good amount of time. They come in a resealable bag.

It’s recommended that these are for dogs older than 1. We have 2 dogs- a pit bull and a Frenchie who can both chew threw almost anything. They ate these rings in about 2 minutes so they didn’t get much chewing time out of them unfortunately. I gave them one every other day until we ran out of the pack. I did notice a difference in their breath smelling better however I didn’t notice any changes in tartar or plaque build up but that’s probably because my dogs chew them too quickly.

I opened the bag and when my dogs came inside they all immediately started sniffing the air!  They loved these.  My little dogs took their time chewing (30 minutes) but my husky ate hers rather quickly, in about 5 minutes.  The only con I saw was the instructions said to give one of my dogs 1/4 of a ring and the other 2 dogs 1/2 a ring.

Per the directions, based on his size, I give him one-half a ring each day. It took me a bit to figure out how to break it in two - we squeeze it until it snaps, rather than trying to bend it. Our pup loves it so much that he whimpers by the pantry door when he's finished it. It doesn't last long, though. I also don't know how well it will work for his teeth, but it certainly can't hurt.

I like these rings because being made primarily from rice powder and think they are likely easier to digest than regular chews.  I also like the ring shape because she has to break it into smaller pieces before eating the treats.  I can't give her bully sticks because she'll eat large pieces at once instead of chewing them.  These rings seem to taste good to her too.  She won't chew on things that don't have a strong flavor and she was so happy the first time I took one out of the bag.,Positive

She was quick to eat the whole thing- so quick that I doubt there is any dental benefits.  These are sold as a one-size-fits all, but medium and small dogs are directed to eat less than a ring a day.  This means you would need to part out the circle, which then gives them an end to easily chew on and it's gone in no time.

He's not a picky eater, but there are some treat flavors he won't eat. It didn't take him long to  make this ring-shaped chew disappear, maybe a full minute if that.  The package may say it's for 'strong' chewers, but it sure doesn't seem like it. Maybe it's also based on dog size?  Our American Bulldog is a big chonker, and he chewed through this treat like it was nothing more than a marshmallow. Our little ten pound Min Pin mix took a lot longer to devour her piece, but she also didn't have any trouble biting through the treat. Price here on Amazon is certainly better than the box box pet stores, where these bags sell for at least twice the price (at least around here in NY well outside of the city). We've bought these rings before as our A.B. loved their puppy teething rings when he was that age. They also have a pumpkin flavor, but we've yet to come across ANY dog - be it our own or that of friends or family or even shelter pups - that like that flavor.  But the chicken flavored chewy rings, like these, are quickly taken after a cursory sniff.

1068,B01HGMDO2U,Katie,5,Ready for a long story?,2/15/20,"Well you’re here reading so I guess you are. Six years ago I decided to adopt cat. I didn’t know which one yet just that I wanted a cat in my life. I went to a local shelter and found one that I liked a lot. When I talked to the clerk there she told me that the little guy I liked was really sick, and that their vet couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him. I got nervous about the costs associated with an undiagnosed illness, and when I made my thoughts known the clerk said “he’s not the cat for you.” I gave her this look of “excuse me?” And she continued saying, “when it’s your cat, you’ll know. And you won’t care what’s wrong or how much the medical bills might be, you’ll just know.” She suggested I go check out a couple other places and that if my heart was truly set on this little guy I could come back for him. Turns out she was right. He wasn’t the little guy for me, although I’m sure he found a very happy home. I went to another shelter that day and when I walked in, I turned to the cat room (it was very small and had no door) and started to go in. I remember the shelter was really loud. It was small so there wasn’t much of a barrier between the dogs and cats. But over all the chaotic noise I just heard this heartbreaking meow. I looked at the back of the room and there was this little grey floof meowing at the top of his lungs, standing up on his hind legs just staring at me. I immediately went over and got him out of the cage, and didn’t put him down again until we got home. I didn’t even ask if he’d had health issues, because that clerk was right. I didn’t care. Little did I know I chose a floof (named Jasper) that would end up with some serious health issues, costing around $6000 for the hospital stay and surgery, and expensive prescription food thereafter. Jasper had crystals in his bladder that he was unable to pass through his urethra. He almost died when it was at its worst, and even though it was suggested to me to put him down, I told the vet to try anything he could to save him. The surgery has a 50% success rate which is not great, but it was a success for Jasper. However, he now needs some special care to ensure he stays healthy. Although the prescription food helped immensely, I noticed he was still having digestive issues, and has had a couple of flare ups with his bladder. I tried so many different things but nothing really worked until I found these random cranberry treats on amazon. I figured, what the heck. Might as well. And they were a godsend. Not only is Jasper OBSESSED with these treats, but they help him so much! As long as I consistently give him these treats he doesn’t get bladder flare ups, and he throws up a lot less (now it’s just the occasional hairball for which I started using Loxatene). In general they just keep him much healthier and happier, and they’re ten times better than the royal canine prescription treats. A few months back they stopped selling these, and immediately Jasper started having some issues again. I’m so glad they’re back in stock, and I hope they stay that way. If your cat has urinary tract issues, I am begging you, try these! It is absolutely and by far the best product for kitty UT issues on the market. Quality ingredients, and proven to work. And for the record, I am not being paid or sponsored for this review. I just truly truly believe in this company and these treats after everything Jasper and I have been through.

As he's getting on his years and UTIs are an issue for male cats I try to give these to him daily. At 16 lbs he gets about 12 of these per day, I throw them across the room and he screams joyfully as he flies upwards, getting several feet of air. Sometimes one gets under a bookcase and then he goes mad trying to pry his precious out from under the thieving piece of furniture. I don't dare go near the bag when it's not Treat Time as he will get all riled up and becomes utterly unbearable.The weird thing is initially when I first got these he did not care for them. I didn't give him any for a few weeks and suddenly he developed a taste for them, I'm not sure what kitty crack they put in these things.My other cat does not care for these. One sniff and she turns to me with this annoyed face like I'm wasting her valuable cat-time.So your cat's reactions to this will vary (every kitty is an individual and she/he has different preferences). If they don't like it, try again later or give it to another fellow cat owner to enjoy.Edit: I have updated my review from 4 stars to 5 stars.It's 10 months since my previous review and my cat still loves them! And they help keep his weight down as we have made a game where I shake the bag (and he gets all crazy because he has the exact sound of the bag memorized) before throwing the treat for him to catch/find. I throw him a couple throughout the day so he gets his 9-12 minimum and they keep him active and healthy. The treats are also a nice small size so he doesn't have to struggle at all (senior kitties sometimes have teeth issues so he tries and gives up on the bigger treats that require chewing).

My only issue is that there isn't that much in the bag, especially if you have 3 cats all weighing between 9 to 13 lbs. I would have to give them 7-8 per day, and my ginger cat, 9-12 treats a day. This would definitely finish within a week or so. Also in the packaging, it doesn't mention anything about how it supports and promotes good urinary tract health, or anything with the word ""urinary tract"".

1087,B01HGMDO2U,Farook Koehler,2,Treats That Aren't,11/2/23,"We have a couple older kitties, and we've transitioned them to ""urinary health"" diets. This means out with the old treats (which were likely okay), and in with treats for cats with FLUTD.Our cats totally ignored these treats. Even when hungry, they hardly even sniff them, and have not eaten a single treat. So, one can infer that at least some cats don't like these alleged ""treats"". From that, one can safely conclude that for those cat owners, this is $6 wasted.Yes, cats can be persnickety, and maybe change their minds about things. Our cats are somewhere in the middle of that continuum, but when it's dinner time, and the treats aren't even sniffed at, I think that's a good sign that the treats ... aren't ""treats"".I should also mention that we've tried many different brands of treats down through the years, and none have been so roundly rejected as these. So, you can take your chances buying these. They are roughly double the price of typical treats.",Negative

She has recurrent UTI's and has regular visits to the vet for antibiotic courses to treat the infections, but she has generally been very low energy and strains to pee quite often. I bought these treats as a last ditch effort to see if the cranberries could help keep the acidity up in her urinary tract to prevent bacterial growth because that's a home remedy my mom brought up for when people get UTIs as well. After a week of feeding her these treats and not changing her diet/any other significant lifestyle factors, her personality and mood and urinary habits have transformed significantly, and I'm so happy she's doing better. I didnt realize that there were also so many vitamins in these treats too, and I think they've also helped make a big difference.

She had blood in her urine and I bought these same day and fed her like a prescription 8-9 treats 3 times a day.  By day 3, I would have taken her to the vet, but she started drinking more water(I put 1 large coffee mug of water on each of my night stands) as she likes to hang out in my bed.  I would suggest more water bowls where they are, as she wouldn’t walk to the kitchen for her water fountain! Baby was sick. Like humans we don’t get out of bed sick.  These are absolutely a game changer and my pet insurance many pets pays for these as a holistic treat option.  I now give her these daily for maintenance to help bacteria in the urine along with Iams uti food or a UTI food. Like a regular antibiotic they take time to full heal.  Per medical medium- cranberry is a natural antibiotic for streptococcus bacteria which causes UTI.All the best with your fur baby-Ms. Nika’s mommy",Positive

1096,B01HGMDO2U,C. Tsiokos,2,Iffy for urinary tract and product integrity,3/12/23,"I tried these treats in hope of replacing Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Adult Cat Treats, which can be very difficult to find. My cat's on a strict urinary tract health diet and I supplement his regular food with treats throughout the day.He didn't go for these at first, which was an early bad sign as he usually gobbles up treats. Ingredients say these have chicken as the primary ingredient, which he loves. So it's curious why he wouldn't take to them. After a couple more tries, he started eating them, but didn’t seem too enthusiastic.Another issue: I ordered 3 bags to take advantage of a 3-for-the-price-of-2 checkout coupon. I got 3 bags, but only 2 contained the full 2.5 ounces of treats. The 3rd bag is about a third full, despite being in the same packaging as the other two. It clearly doesn't contain the listed 2.5 ounces. It's not that big a deal, considering I paid for 2 and got a little more than 2 bags' worth, but still, it makes me question if the company's not playing fast and loose in other ways.And, as others have noted, despite the Amazon listing, there's nothing on the product's packaging that specifically says these treats are good for a urinary tract health diet. Are they really? Can you believe the ingredient listing at all?Considering these issues together, it makes me question if I can trust the company and their product claims. It all seems shady. Therefore I don't think I'll ever order these again for my cat.",Negative

My cat never had any urinary problems before eating these, and she has none now either. The treats themselves are crunchy, small and heart shaped. My cat doesn't love these (like she does some others... as she's ""tempted"" by another kind). She is though happy to have something different than just her regular food. These are well priced, although I'd like to make a suggestion to you all. I have purchased a bag of dry food, different than her regular, daily kibble (I bought it here, on Amazon). I use it as a ""treat"" for her, and whatever I give her, I subtract the same amount from her daily ration. This way, she thinks that she's getting her treats, but won't put on extra weight (which so many cats do, for this reason alone). It'll also save ALOT of money considering, for instance that a five pound bag of dry food would equal more than 20 bags of treats. Whoa, that's alot of money! My daughter turned me on to this idea, and I think she's pretty amazing for thinking of it. I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy these, especially if their cat does have urinary issues. But, I can't say that they would have any effect on it. Possibly checking with your cat's vet might be a good idea.",Neutral

He recently got blocked again and was hospitalized.  I swore this time I would be as vigilant as I could for the rest of his life.  But ... he liked his food and treats and the variety ... so I got him 3 different kinds of urinary food and a bunch of treats.  These were a new brand to me.

1107,B01HGMDO2U,Anne M. Helmenstine,5,Wonderful (If Your Cat Will Eat Them),6/19/18,"My young male cat had blood in his urine, couldn't void completely, and had crystals. Honestly, I didn't think he'd make it. It's a multi-cat household, so I didn't catch his problem until it was dire. We already had a cat fountain, but added water dishes throughout the house and immediately switched to Purina Pro Plan for urinary health (he refuses wet food). One weird trick that worked to increase hydration was to sprinkle water onto cat grass before letting him nibble it. I ordered these treats because he loves snacks and already felt deprived from the new food and miserable from the crystals. I was told eating smaller meals more frequently helps control urine pH. He loves them! I have to hide the bag so he won't bite into it and help himself. I can't say whether the snacks help, but they don't appear to hurt. He's on the mend and is even playing with the other cats. However, if you're on the fence about these treats, it's true they are a love or hate thing. While the cat with urinary issues loves these, every other cat rejects them. I don't know whether there is something in them the one cat instinctively senses will help or he's just less picky. The size of the treats and crunch factor seems about the same as other treats. The recommended daily amount for a small cat is 5-6 per day (twice that for a large cat), so while the package is small, I think they will last a while.

Recently, I decided to get him on a VERY high, very expensive quality dry kibble. After several weeks on the new food and after multiple tests with a pH strip, I started noticing the pH of his urine became very basic instead of acidic, which is where it needs to be. I decided I'd try these to see if it helped so I could keep him on the new food because I adore the ingredients. I fed him the serving size every day for a week, continued testing his urine and didn't notice a difference in the pH. I think all these did was just make him a little fatter. Great.

So I bought these, Iams dry cat food to support urinary function, and HomeoPet Feline UTI+ drops. I knew I wasn't going to be able to directly administer the drops, so I made sure that she liked these cranberry treats, and She Did! So, then I put the homeopet drops, one on each treat, and she ate those too! 3 days have gone by and I no longer smell the strong urine smell. So, I will keep them both on the new Iams, and buy more of these treats for regular use. Very happy, and so is Miss Munchkin!",Positive

I also had my vet look at the ingredients and she said it looks fine.  I didn't realize I wasn't giving him as many as they suggest so will give him more now but trying to keep him from getting more than his current 15lbs.  I think my only complaint is these aren't available in a larger size. an 8oz or 1 lb bag would be great if the company reads our reviews.",Positive

My vet told me to stop giving him treats as well. I felt bad that I had to take away all of his treats so I was researching for treats that can help with urinary issues.There are not a lot of options out there so I purchased Get Naked, Purina Pro Plan, and Royal Canin treats. My cat wasn't too fond of any of the treats but absolutely did not like the Get Naked treats. He tolerated the Royal Canin.The treats were worth a try. Too bad there are not any urinary treats in the market for cats that are soft in texture.",Neutral

Hes ok now, but he continued having some issues after arriving back home for almost a week. Aside from changing his diet, one of the things I did was buy him these treats instead of the usual stuff I normally get at the grocery store. He absolutely loves these! I can't definitively say that they're doing anything for him medically because I'm not a vet or a cat, but at least the odds that these treats would contribute to another blockage are slim and I feel better knowing that cranberry does have a proven track record of helping people.",Positive

Female and young-ish, so I had a feeling it was a UTI. I bought these to try to help at least a little with keeping her clear after her $700 trip to the emergency vet.

My eldest cat has to be tricked into eating these with coverups and additives. But my other boy just gobbles them up and askes for more. However I think it has something to do with how hard the treats are, maybe they're too hard for one to like.

My other cat will eat them, but doesn’t seem crazy about them.I bough these to ensure my cats’ urinary tract health, and while the description for the Amazon listing currently says they’re for urinary health, the bag is labeled as a general “cat health with cranberry.” Either the bag or the Amazon listing needs some updating.",Positive

I also have to be very careful with what she eats - including treats! She loves these! They are heart shaped and not very thick but crunchy! Obviously I have no idea how they taste - but if she eats them they must be pretty good! And , knock on wood, she hasn't had another UTI in quite some time!!!

I always watch what I put into my animal's bodies so the ingredients of this treat were very nice. My eight year old Domestic Shorthair loves them. This is Dip's first time trying a crunchy treat and after me persuading her to eat them, she now loves them. My ten year old Russian Blue doesn't like treats at all and she doesn't like human food so I knew she wouldn't try these. But my DS still loves them and I am a happy cat owner knowing that these treats are healthy for her and her kidneys. Will definitely recommend to friends and will buy again when needed.",Positive

I put them on a tall wrought iron trellis and can't remove to return because my trailing flowers have grown all around the wires and lights.  Come fall I will remove and return to company, and hopefully they will replace.  I truly believe this third set was just defective, as the other two sets are still working and really are pretty.  If anyone from the company is reading this, please contact me.  I would love the replacement now to complete the look of my garden patio.  I can only give three stars due to the defective third set.

Amazing choice when the cat is tired of eating the same urinary treats!,5/22/21,I see a bunch of reviews on here that made me uneasy to buy but the reviews were of people who knew their cats were picky so they gave this product a 4 or lower because of the cats pickiness which isn’t fair to the company. The product is very high quality! My cat absolutely loves the treats. I’m guessing the cranberry in it is his favorite! Not many treats when your cats have urinary problems but this is amazing!,Positive

That means a variety of taste buds and plenty of individuality.With that said, nobody liked these.  A couple would eat a few of them occasionally, but in general, they just got a sniff before stalking off in disgust.We have a couple of cats with tendencies towards urinary tract problems.  It was a great idea, but if they won't eat them, it's pointless.  (Neither of our UTI cats will touch them.)  Maybe some cats will be more interested, but at our house, they were a bust.",Negative

I desperately needed an effective way to improve my older dog's teeth (and Bark Bright REALLY works!) but I didn't want to spend that much on my puppy yet ($25/month) nor did I want her to have 75+ extra calories (although I did a few times break the Bark Bright sticks in smaller halves for her when I didn't have alternative yet).These puppy chews seem to be tasty to BOTH my dogs, and they are always happy to have them.  They do not last more than A MINUTE or TWO (maybe 2 with my puppy, but definitely less than 1 minute for my 7 year old husky shepherd mix).These are ""small"" and there are about 16-18 sticks per bag, so they are a good alternative (only about 27 calories per stick) for my puppy as my older dog gets his Bark Bright stick every morning.  I get the Joint Health ones in this brand as a back up/snack for both dogs and they both also love to get them (follow me, sit alert and wait for them!) every single time.",Positive

I have tried the Whimzies puppy dental chews as well as one other brand and, none of them got quite a reaction out of my puppy as the Get Naked brand. I also really love that they are helping to provide my girl with the proper nutrients she needs while developing. They are a bit small, however, for a growing large breed puppy and, expensive when you factor in that you should be feeding them to your dog twice a day.

We spend a lot of money on dental work for her, because even with regular teeth brushing and check ups, her age and genetics gave my poor senior dog serious teeth problems. For my puppy, I like that she's getting her teeth cleaned while giving me 20 minutes of respite from her antics. Nice to see her chomp on something other than my bum or ankles :). Yay! My senior dog with missing teeth takes about 40 minutes, but she looks forward to it every day. We're happy when she's happy! We still brush her teeth daily, but it's great that she gets as much support as possible for her dental health.

Smells like mint chocolate to me, (it doesn't contain chocolate). I don't think this cleans teeth very well, so make sure to be brushing your dogs teeth regularly (as any responsible dog parent should be). This does however, do wonders for stinky breath. If you're not brushing your dog's teeth then the smell may continue despite using these, due to the plaque buildup.

He’s super healthy and a smarty pants too... not sure if there’s a direct correlation to the chews but you never know?!The sticks last him a while... he usually eats some of it and then comes back to it the next day or so.

I like that they have GOOD things inside, not random yucky bits like so many dog treats. We've gone through ten packs of these in various flavors and will continue to buy them for her as long as she continues to love them (we rotate flavors so she doesn't get bored).

It has been now 5 months since I have been getting these chews and she has not thrown up AT ALL.

Not many dental sticks say if they're okay for puppies, especially with a little guy like mine.  Just wanted to be safe.  He started on these since he was 11 weeks.

I didn't have a problem with them however, I came across these and they sounded like a good idea to try.

I used my sharpest knife but when I gave several to my dog, he tried to chew them but wasn't able to. He tried for several minutes but then just spit it out and walked away from it.  I have a miniature schnauzer.  I guess they might be OK for a larger dog.Sorry ""get naked"", but these are much too hard for my pup to chew.

He was teething very bad so I thought these could help him and I was a big fan of the natural ingredient claim with the added benefit. I made a mistake of not checking the ingredients. I don't understand who would put peppermint oil in a dog treat. This is absolutely toxic for any dog. Peppermint oil should not even be on your dog's skin let alone get ingested. I have been feeding this to my puppy for a few weeks now until I realized this. I am throwing them out immediately. I wanted to let people know out there that this is not good for your dog and it should not be fed to them.

Puppy is teething so I can give him this to stop biting what is wrong to bite. He enjoys the taste. Seems like it takes forever to finish one.

I can’t actually give one of them a treat without giving both of them the same thing.

She is very hyperactive and bitey probably due to her teething, which has curbed her desire to bite everything within sight. If you have a bitey puppy, keep one of these on hand to have them chew on. In my opinion, they are a bit small, quite soft, and bendable. Because of that I always make sure to supervise my puppy while she's chewing on it just in case. It seems to last her a good amount, 1 per day for a 2-pound puppy. The recommendation on the back feels spot on so follow it.",Positive

We have purchased both the Chicken and Bacon flavored treats in the past. One thing to note. It seems that the company recently changed their Chicken flavored treat product. However, reading the ingredients for the older version and the new version, they are identical but the treats themselves are NOT the same. The Chicken flavored product used to be a brown color and both our ferrets loved those treats. We recently purchased the Chicken flavor treats again and they were the same dark brown (nearly black) color of the Bacon flavored treats.

I have heard reports that some dogs have choked or got them stuck in their mouths and throats. So to be safe, make sure your dog is in eyes view of you while he treats himself to these. They are apparently tasty to them. I started giving him the peanut butter ones for a bit of variety and now he won’t eat any more of both flavors. Lol I may have just gave them to him a bit too much and he got tired of them too quickly but everything seemed fine before the peanut butter ones.

Now that she's 8-lbs, it looks like she can eat the whole bag in one hour. The bones are about 1/4-inch wide. So, we are cutting the treats in half and putting them outside for the squirrels, who might find them too small too. To be fair, there are a good amount of treats in the bag.

Takes him just a couple of minutes to chew, but settles him right down and he knows it is part of the routine.  I wish they were just a little longer in length so that they would last longer, but they work okay for settling.  I don't think they do much for satisfying the need to chew, as there are better options for that, but they are a nice treat.  There are puppy teething rings made by this same company which last a bit longer - but they also cost more and you don't get very many in a package.  I use those when I have them for the same purpose of settling my puppy down at bedtime, but they also don't do much to satisfy the need to chew, despite the name of the product.

I have two King Charles Cavaliers and used these for both when they were puppies and I also used them for the litter of pups we just had. For a small breed dogs and young pups these do work great for teething. I gave them to the pups when they started getting teeth and they were unable to ""eat"" them yet but they loved the taste and it did help them with teething. Once they got older and were able to eat them it was more of a reward yes but it still helped with their back teeth which take the longest time to ""pop out"".

I ended up buying more online. These were much harder (probably older) but she loves playing fetch with them.  We play for like an hour a day.  They slide and roll beautifully and are light enough that although she is a small cat she can easily carry them, and even jump onto my bed/couch with them.

1603,B09FQDFF3Q,Briana,5,One of my cats favorite treats,2/14/24,I wanted to find a soft treat for my cats that was healthy and had cranberry in it that my cats would both eat. That is tricky nowadays having two cats with different tastebuds. However ever since I’ve found this on a pet store shelf I will search until I can get my hands on it! I only can find it online now but it makes me feel better that my cats are getting a healthy treat in them that hopefully will help prevent issues down the line.,Positive
1604,B09FQDFF3Q,LESLIE OBRIEN,5,4 paws up,11/19/21,"So, the super finicky felines that rule the house can, coincidentally, be super finicky about their treats. One will throw up if he gets more than 2-3 at one time, another looks at them and gives me a blank look as if asking “What did you just try to pawn off on me?”, and then there’s the third one that is all-the-treats-all-the-time. So I have a hard time finding treats that they will all like or at least two out of three. So what did they think of these?Smell (that’s mostly me): On the mild side. Didn’t really smell like chicken to me.Hard/soft: Very soft. Two of the cats seemed to eat them okay, but the one that’s missing most of her teeth had trouble with them.Taste (that’s them): they seemed a bit dubious and I think that might be down to the mild smell. While they did eat them, the toothless one was the slower of the three to jump on them.Overall: I like that this product is made in the USA and it’s for all life stages since ours range from 4-11yo. I’ve also found that they do seem to enjoy cranberry when it’s in their foods, which is always a bonus for me (and them). And at the listed price, it’s about on par with other similar products out there. In looking at the brand, I also see that there’s other flavor options, which I intend to investigate.",Neutral

I have raised since they were kittens abandoned and skinny as they ate only trash. I quickly got them back on their feet thanks to treats like these. Every stray cat that comes to my house gets some of these Biteable treats a long with some other cat food. Every cat loves these treats!

1617,B09FQDFF3Q,Briana,5,One of my cats favorite treats,2/14/24,I wanted to find a soft treat for my cats that was healthy and had cranberry in it that my cats would both eat. That is tricky nowadays having two cats with different tastebuds. However ever since I’ve found this on a pet store shelf I will search until I can get my hands on it! I only can find it online now but it makes me feel better that my cats are getting a healthy treat in them that hopefully will help prevent issues down the line.,Positive
1618,B09FQDFF3Q,LESLIE OBRIEN,5,4 paws up,11/19/21,"So, the super finicky felines that rule the house can, coincidentally, be super finicky about their treats. One will throw up if he gets more than 2-3 at one time, another looks at them and gives me a blank look as if asking “What did you just try to pawn off on me?”, and then there’s the third one that is all-the-treats-all-the-time. So I have a hard time finding treats that they will all like or at least two out of three. So what did they think of these?Smell (that’s mostly me): On the mild side. Didn’t really smell like chicken to me.Hard/soft: Very soft. Two of the cats seemed to eat them okay, but the one that’s missing most of her teeth had trouble with them.Taste (that’s them): they seemed a bit dubious and I think that might be down to the mild smell. While they did eat them, the toothless one was the slower of the three to jump on them.Overall: I like that this product is made in the USA and it’s for all life stages since ours range from 4-11yo. I’ve also found that they do seem to enjoy cranberry when it’s in their foods, which is always a bonus for me (and them). And at the listed price, it’s about on par with other similar products out there. In looking at the brand, I also see that there’s other flavor options, which I intend to investigate.",Neutral

No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household.

Part of it is definitely that he can sink his teeth into it multiple times (kinda like a hard wax texture?), part of it is the shape due to how he tosses it, and another must be the flavor.  Thankfully it doesn't smell as bad as the bully stick nor the cod skins we have.  The cod skins do not offer the ""teeth sinking"" feeling this does, and while bully sticks do they stink so much.I would note that these rings do leave a sticky hard residue, likely from the rice flour or maybe the gelatin as it reminds me of how my hands feel after getting dried over cooked rice on clothing. His beard and paws feel crunchy afterwards and this can also end up on you, clothing, and furniture. We find this a very fair trade for the length of time this has entertained our landshark puppy though when compared to the smells of bully sticks and codskins (or the left over scales). Some hot water on a wash rag can clean it up easily without stains.",Positive

Now at eight months of age with all her permanent teeth either fully in or growing in, it takes her maybe 15 minutes to finish one off. Still a good busy-time treat while I'm on Zoom calls or as a reward for really good behavior, but I do wish they were a little bit longer lasting.These are also made in the U.S., which is important to me after so many imported pet treats have caused health issues.

When I tried one with my 6 week old Maltipoo, he couldn’t even bite down. He only eats hard food so I was very surprised! I have introduced the rings to him several times over the past 8 weeks.  It hasn’t improved.These teething rings are too large and too hard for small breed puppies. However, they would probably be great for larger breeds.So! They would be great for larger dogs, but they are too big and hard for 3.2 lb. Maltipoos!",Negative

Meat should be the first ingredient in my opinion.I bought my pup some Pur Luv Chicken Jerky, and she goes nuts for those.  The ingredients are:  Chicken Breast, Vegetable Glycerin, Salt...that's all of the ingredients!If you're dog likes Puppy Teething Sticks, I'm glad.  They are affordable and look like they will last long.  But if they don't, try Pur Lov Chicken Jerky.",Negative
1707,B09R6FX8LH,bee,5,Longest lasting chewy,8/7/23,I have older dogs and though they like a chewy stick it needs to be soft enough to not break their teeth. I used one Nylabone that broke my one dogs teeth = a 1k vet bill. I now get chews labeled for puppies. This last about 45 minutes of focused chewing. I think the ingredients are good as neither dogs have any digestive reactions from them. They are expensive so it’s their Sunday treat.,Negative

I think he swallows too soon and doesn’t chew it down enough. Either way he will throw up chunks of it all night long. So I threw the rest away. I even tried holding it and letting him teeth on it that way but he was still trying to eat too large of pieces. They don’t even look like they have digested much at all when they come out. Even if its been 8 hrs since he ate it. But he loved the taste! So if your dog is good at chewing things up, I would recommend. If yours is like mine and likes to swallow big chunks, do not recommend.",Negative

And I’ve learned they want the exact same treat.I am not strong enough to break this ring in pieces. So I give one to my older dog. She breaks it up. The little dog grabs a piece and runs.Of course all the other pieces get eaten by my 12 year old dog.Since I don’t have the flexibility to give them smaller pieces, it gives the older dog much more of this treat at one time than I would prefer.Both of my dogs devour this in record time.  No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household. Or maybe if you had an older dog who did not want every single thing the puppy gets… and vice versa.But, for me and my family, it isn’t quite working out the way I hoped.It is a good product.

Now within the first five minutes he has broken the ring and goes from chewing to eating.-when the ring comes in contact with saliva it gets really really sticky. A mess for humans to pick up by hand-as a dog chews/eats it, little clumps get dislodged everywhere, radioactive yellow colored.

Part of it is definitely that he can sink his teeth into it multiple times (kinda like a hard wax texture?), part of it is the shape due to how he tosses it, and another must be the flavor.  Thankfully it doesn't smell as bad as the bully stick nor the cod skins we have.  The cod skins do not offer the ""teeth sinking"" feeling this does, and while bully sticks do they stink so much.I would note that these rings do leave a sticky hard residue, likely from the rice flour or maybe the gelatin as it reminds me of how my hands feel after getting dried over cooked rice on clothing. His beard and paws feel crunchy afterwards and this can also end up on you, clothing, and furniture. We find this a very fair trade for the length of time this has entertained our landshark puppy though when compared to the smells of bully sticks and codskins (or the left over scales). Some hot water on a wash rag can clean it up easily without stains.",Positive

I made do by cutting those in half until we used them all up, but the tiny puppy ones are just the right size.When she was younger, a ring would keep her occupied for a good 30 mins or more. Now at eight months of age with all her permanent teeth either fully in or growing in, it takes her maybe 15 minutes to finish one off. Still a good busy-time treat while I'm on Zoom calls or as a reward for really good behavior, but I do wish they were a little bit longer lasting.These are also made in the U.S., which is important to me after so many imported pet treats have caused health issues.

1873,B00061MULK,Hana Lee,5,My cat is addicted to these,8/17/20,"I have two cats. One of them played with these sticks for a little while but didn't seem to figure out they were chewable, even when I stuck them in his mouth. Oh well, he's a little dumb anyway.The other cat LOVES them. She needs her stick fix every day. She gets one at 6pm and the other around midnight, and she knows it - when the time comes she'll go to the kitchen counter and start meowing and begging for them. Sometimes she plays fetch with the stick, but most of the time we throw it for her, she runs after it, grabs it and starts chowing down. She even figured out how to stick one end into the high pile carpet so that she can keep it stable while she gnaws on the other end. They seem to be doing a good job of keeping my girl cat's teeth clean; we have to give dental treats and water additives for the other cat. We've been subscribed to these sticks for over a year now and she goes through about three packs a month.So your mileage may vary with these sticks. From my sample size of 2, there's a 50% chance of stick addiction and 50% chance that they'll totally flop. Even so, I have to give them 5 stars because of how much my girl loves them. If they ever discontinue these, I'm going to have a very unhappy cat on my hands.Oh, and the first few times you give these to your cat, keep a close eye on them. My cat has never choked in her 1 year plus of eating these every day, but she has taken bites that were too large and immediately vomited them up after - I guess the large chunks didn't sit well in her stomach. If you have a very small kitten, they may choke.",Positive

I gave one to the dog to show him they're the same thing but time after time he still turned away from it.I do know cats don't normally find ""chew"" toys necessary since cats don't typically chew in the same way dogs do. So perhaps this bone broth stick is just too hard for cats in general. But i think tbr taste is fine bc other animals in the house see it as a treat. in the end I turned to just finding some some what mildly freezed dried meat treats for his chewy-like behavior.Dogs however love the bone broth stick. I gave the rest of the bag to a toy poodle owner and her 2 dogs loved them. So 3 stars for decent dog treats that has the word cat on the bag.

This has been a lifesaver for me because my cat has a G.I. issue and I have realize that when she starts trying to chew everything in my home office while I’m working, that it’s because her tummy is aggravating her. I now leave the sticks in my desk and when she starts chewing on my artificial plants and papers and pens, I offer her a stick and she now comes running. The downside is that she can’t hold it on her own without me holding it. However, it absolutely does the trick  and stops her from Destroying my house and eating something that she is not supposed to eat. She’s also fine with just less than one stick per day.It’s surprisingly sit well on her stomach as well and that makes me happy, because there’s not a lot of treats out there that she can have with a diet that she’s on. I don’t think of these like a cat treat, but more of a chew therapy for a cat that needs to chew on some thing. Hope this helps people in similar situations. Best advice, offer it to your cat when you see them chewing because they are more likely to try it and once they try it they may like it more. Again I would not offer this as just an occasional every day treat, as there are probably better ones out there if your cat does not have stomach issues.",Positive

None of my other four cats like them, they won't even lick them. But for Ollie it seems to sate his chewing urge for a while really well.

These have been a welcome addition to the house. We've been sticking them near things that he likes to chew on, and evidently they're a bit more enticing because he's been leaving the other stuff around the house alone. He seems to really enjoy biting bits off so there are little pea-sized nodules peppered around the area but he's no longer putting himself at risk by chewing on electrical cords so I consider this an absolute success. Plus it seems that it's fun to play with because even the ones he's knocked loose from the places we've wedged them he'll roll around on and kick. Definitely recommend for chewers.",Positive

He is a 13 week main coon/bengal tabby mix, and he still hasn't mastered how to chew on the stick but he loves the flavor and is definitely interested in them. The stick themselves ARE soft enough for a cat to break the stick down with bites and chunks. If you do own a cat that is a chewer, then you may want watch them, just so they don't choke. I'm glad that it is easy for the cat to chew but not too soft that Mr. Biggles looses interests or eats them and moves on. Considering that there are enough chew bones in a 3.37 oz package, being that they are 4"" sticks each, I feel that they will last several month. Mr. Biggles is teething, but that much of a chewer. Being that these are all natural and made in the USA, this makes the product an even more handsome buy. ***Edit Review**** My. Mr. Biggles eats the stick in 4 minutes or less. He mastered this by 7 months old. They are his 2nd favorite to chew on, 1st is bison lung. He has clean teeth and no bad breath. I moved on to bully and raw hide, it lasts longer.",Positive

My kitten won't use any teething toys, but he loves these!I don't really understand how someone can complain about there being more wheat and corn than chicken in this. They are supposed to be hard to wear down. I can't see this being possible with chicken being the primary ingredient. The formulation is perfectly right for what the product actually IS. Your cat isn't going to sit there and eat the entire thing in one sitting, so I'm pretty sure a little more wheat and corn than chicken isn't going to kill them.If you don't like the idea of your cats chewing on anything that isn't pure meat, you're not going to find anything like this usable. If your cat is allergic, you already know they are because you'll have to purchase special food for them, as well. N.y cats eat natural food, where meat is the primary ingredient, and there's still some veggies and grains in there, because in general they are GOOD for them and make up part of a well balanced diet.If your cat has allergies, though, you'll be happy to know there are catnip sticks on Amazon, too, which are literally sticks that have been broken off from the plant. Problem solved.This product though doesn't deserve the bashing another reviewer here gave it. My cats love it, they love their food too for that matter (they were the ones that picked it), and they're healthy. That's all I can really ask for.",Positive

My cat is a biter and LOVES to chew on a good (iPhone) cord or paper. I tried buying him a chicken flavored plastic dog bone, but I think it was too big for him to put around his mouth and actually chew on. The first time I tried to give this to my cat, Stan, he didn't really know what to do with it. He licked it a little bit and was just over it. I thought it was a failure. Then one day, he was play biting at me on the couch and I put the bone in place of my finger and he started chewing it. It took a LONG time of me holing the bone/treat while he chewed away for him to finish the first one, I was also a little concerned when it got broken down into a smaller size that it could be a choking hazard, but it's been fine. He just started his second treat and this time he knew what he was doing and at half of it in one sitting. I think it was a successful purchase for me, but I'm sure it's totally dependent on the cat.",Positive

Think mine may just be lazy, cause our dogs love them.  Too expensive to buy for dogs though.. I gave them 4 stars because I don't think anything is wrong with them.  Just maybe wrong animal.  I bought because I felt the concept is good.  Cats get bored with just treat pieces sometimes.  I think if these had a stronger smell and were less bound by a waxy covering my cats would like them better.

The bad news is that she only chews these if I literally stick them in her mouth. She doesn't seem to care for the flavor (if there is any), and if I'm not actively giving it to her, she's only interested in it as a toy to knock off the desk. It's been a few months, and she's really only gnawed a bit at the end of one stick. The only saving grace for this product is that I feel safer using it as a chewing distraction (I can't imagine that the metal/plastic of pens and pencils is any good for her if it breaks off in her mouth).

I had already tried Greenies, but my greedy cat gobbled them whole without chewing them. Definitely needed something in stick form that he would have to pull apart. Stumbled across these on Amazon and they work great. No more bad breath, and more importantly, no more dental issues. He gets a clean bill every checkup!

So I gave him his first treat and timed how long it took him to eat it. One minute and fifty-six seconds. He was a super determined and single-minded about it, and he is a large cat so I am sure that made it easier for him. It didn’t take him nearly as long as I had hoped, but it kept him occupied longer than anything else I have found, and let him take out some of his need to chew on something he is actually allowed to chew.

He has a problem with eating things he's not supposed to and I was looking for something to help relieve his chewing on bad things. I always hated how they didn't have any good chew things for cats because I can attest that chew cats exist! Well my cat didn't want anything to do with these chews... The packaging makes it look like it's a meaty chew, but its actually a firm clear-ish gelatinous stick, I'm assuming its a juice or or artificial flavoring? I won't be buying these again, but I'm glad this is on the market because I'm sure some cats would love it, just not mine. It's well packaged and is resealable. I'd like to suggest an alternative that I found that my cat actually likes. It's Dogswell Happy Hips Salmon or Chicken Jerky. They're made for dogs but they're just dehydrated meat with no hormones or additives so it's good for cats too, and your cat may like it if it doesn't like these because it's actually meat!",Negative

However, when you have 2 who like to play fetch, and gnaw on things because they're young and full of energy and like to chew on things they shouldn't, they love these. I will add though, that they do like Sentry Petrodex VS Dental Twist Treats better, but I want to make sure there's something for them to chew and give them options. The other cats besides these two, just stare at the sticks and walk away after sniffing them. Putting it into their food dish isn't even a good hint. So, your cat will either really love them or really hate them. It only takes one bag to find out.",Neutral

The tender meaty stick treats might last all of 90 seconds with him. These treats sounded like something that he could really work on and satisfy his chewing urges thereby saving our shoestrings, hoodie pulls and cords. He carried the stick around all over the house, put it in a shoe and licked then gnawed on it for about 10 minutes before giving up and leaving it sticky and melding into the carpet.",Positive

Well, these are not it, because he didn't even register that it was food. He sniffed it, and then rubbed his face on it and walked off.Ok, I certainly don't blame a product for my cat not liking it; cats can have different taste just like people. As I do with many treats my cat doesn't care for, I tried giving it to my neighbor's outdoor cat who visits daily (needless to say, for treats). She was completely uninterested. I laid it on the doormat thinking she might go for it eventually, and I had to go back to work and forgot about it. Over the next couple hours, not one but two of my neighbor's dogs came by (up to my door, where they stare intently at my cat through the screen). The NEXT DAY, after which who knows what else (including y'know, bugs and other wildlife) could have eaten the blasted thing, there it was, whole, on my door mat.I'm not positive what is in this, but whatever it is, it must be really, really unappetizing.",Negative

I recently bought a brand name version of a ""chicken stick"" and she went absolutely crazy for it and gobbled it right up.

Got them 5 years ago with the same results for my sister's kitten I was watching while she was deployed. They held more interest when fresh and soft... Once opened and out of the package, they hardened and had to be tossed in a few days.Got 2 kittens this past week, and again--in need of something to shove in their mouth when they go after my fingers. They are a hit with these babies!I feed high quality pet food and treats, and while the ingredients in this don't fit my normal standards, I want something for a few months that they can gnaw on and won't cause blockages if ingested.

I found these to replace those chewies to help me out and he loves them. He plays fetch with them for a while and then just sits down and chews on them.

I have no idea if they actually clean teeth or not, but they do seem to help with his breath at least temporarily. If they do clean teeth that is a bonus, but I would get these anyway because they're good chews.

I was worried about these treats when I first took them out of the bag because they're hard like chalk and my dog is 13 years old. She didn't like them right away but after she started to spend some time on them, they started to dissolve and she could chew on them more easily. These treats are great for distracting dogs but you also have to be careful if they're a smaller dog because the treat is really hard and I could see it could cause choking in over ambitious dogs that don't take the time to break down the treat. The only flaw in these treats is that my dog has a beard and these treats get really milky and foamy and once she finishes her treat it looks like she has rabies and that she's foaming at the mouth. I always find chunks of unfinished twistix dental chews melted to her beard with foam. She loves them so much and they're good for her teeth so I can't complain.

I prefer the smell (and her breath) after eating the vanilla mint, but as far as the dog is concerned, she eats both flavors with equal enthusiasm.Original Review...............My dog loves Twistix but twice now, she's thrown up a couple hours after having one at bed time.  We normally give her the vanilla mint version which she's eaten for over a year without any issues.  For some reason, the yogurt banana version doesn't agree with her system.

2032,B003AYCVVY,ZulaMaeRules,5,Cinnamon Chewy Goodness for Canine Teeth,3/24/14,"Living with a four dog pack as I do, daily brushing can become routine and cumbersome (I do it in the pm with Virbac Vanilla Mint enzymatic toothpaste which they love and which actually contributes to teeth health whether you brush or just swipe it through on a swab - enzymatic, so if you are introducing the idea or have a non cooperative dog it might be a good thing to check out as well for those reasons) so I look for fun ways to add to the process of canine teeth cleaning. I read an article somewhere about this product that made me look into it further. Note here, I am all about natural raw feeding, integrative vet care, wholesome ingredients and positive training and keeping up with new ideas like Reiki for animals. (It really works!).I bought the small chews for my standard size dogs (50 - 70 pounds) because I don't give large treats but prefer to parcel them out. Perfect size. After their breakfast they each get a chew stick and they love them. I feed them in their crates and the floor gets a bit slimy because they break off bits and shove them around but with crate feeding (the rare times the dogs use the crates anymore) the floors get cleaned up anyway. You can smell the cinnamon which I know is good for breath and other ailments in humans as well. One of my concerns with these dental type chews in the past has been the possibility of blockages and these appear to not pose that risk to my dogs, being narrow and chewy and not overly hard with ridges, kind of like a star shaped stick. I only give one a day per dog in the morning because I don't want to upset tummies and I want to keep these a special treat even though these treats have a job. I broke one into fourths and gave them to a friend with a Shi Tzu and suggested one piece per day for him since he is tiny. He loved them. So a little goes a long way. Between the Naked Chew in the morning and the Virbac Enzymatic toothpaste in the evening my dogs teeth are really improving and they are all seniors who had some residue I was looking to improve upon. Teeth are looking shiny white like me after a trip to my favorite dental hygienist. I recommend the combination. The raw diet does contribute of course. These are a safer, healthier dental chew than anything else I've seen with ingredients I am comfortable with offering my dogs in reasonable portions. I recommend supervising your dog at first and considering the size of your dog and the size of the treat and perhaps breaking the treat into smaller portions if you have a smaller dog and offering that either two a day or depending on the sensitivity of your dog's digestion. I order in quantity to reduce cost. I think this is a great product.",Positive

The chews are a good size for my 15ish pound dogs. Both are strong chewers, so the sticks are gone in less than a minute. They have a pleasant, spicy scent like nutmeg or cinnamon. One of my dogs has always had stinky breath, and these seem to freshen his breath, but I have not used these for long enough to say if they improve his dental health.The subscribe and save option is nice, as I have only seen these in one local pet ""boutique"" with a much higher price.",Positive

He is about 55 pounds and does go through one rather quickly. But he hasn't had an issue at all with them affecting his stomach (which is AMAZING!) I was skeptical at first since a lot of dog products now say things about helping with digestion. I'm not sure if these actually help with digestion, but seeine as they don't make my pup with a sensitive stomach throw up, they're an A+ in my book! I do wish they made these in bigger sizes. It would last longer for my pup. They do smell a bit odd (they have a slight minty scent) and I was worried about my picky dog not liking that, but he's not affected by it at all.",Positive

With all the sever health issues reported from carrageenan ingestion in humans, you'd think that pet companies like this would remove it from their ingredients and replace it with another safer choice.  Until the company removes this ingredient, I cannot recommend.  It's a shame because these are great dental chews that are not hard on the teeth and my dog loves them.",Negative

The are a good length and my dog runs around the house with them in his mouth. The only thing I will mention is that we've had these now a relatively short time and my bag seems to have gone stale a bit. I sometimes half them and have noticed they are considerably more difficult to do so with my hands after only a couple of weeks. I alternate these with many different variety of dog treats so it would be nice if they stayed fresher longer.

My dog loves them and will sit and beg at 3 pm until he gets one every day but now we won't be able to afford them for this new price. It will be heartbreaking to look at his sad face waiting for his favorite treat and not getting any. Really hope this is just temporary. Taking star off because of this.,Negative

The vets don't seem to think his upset stomach is a big deal, but they've never seen him when he's in the middle of an episode. It's more like a seizure. I've got him off wheat now.

He gets a half of one every night like clockwork, and because of this he always seems to know what time it is really. The other problem besides price would be that they disappear in a flash. I keep them in the fridge so they'll at least be a little harder to wolf down. Can you please make them last longer and then I won't mind the price as much.

Was worried because of reviews over them being crushed. The first pack was perfect but the second and third pack had half of them crushed apart. Since he likes them and they work for him I'll just feed him the crumbs. But some better quality control would be nice.Update: I've been ordering these for a while and it seems like they've taken notice of the texture / crumbling problem and the last 2 bags have been a lot better!,Positive

She immediately went for the treat and when offered her a pinch of the crumbs (see below)  she licked it right up out of my hand and asked for more.Zero stars for Amazon’s shipping. I also purchased a six-lb bag of cat food; they came together in one large box. Predictably, the cat treat package appeared as if it had been repeatedly smashed or stomped on. About 1/4 of the treats remain whole. The rest are big crumbs or just cat treat dust (sandy texture). Amazon did provide me with a refund at my request.I will sprinkle the crumbs in with her kibble or on top of her wet topper so it doesn’t go to waste.  Will update my review to evaluate products claims if I see any improvement or change in her health.",Negative

It is a 5 star product for the hairball relief.I don't like that now the chews are almost turning in to dust right in the bag.  That won't help with the amount you're supposed to give.

But sometimes he just turns his nose up at them and leaves them to sit. I assume the flavor may just not be to my cats preference? I have other treats that he will eat no matter what or when so maybe he realizes it's supposed to help him haha. They're a soft treat and smell alright. He has had less hairballs since I started giving him these so I think it works pretty good. The price is great for how many you get so it's worth giving to your kitty if they do get a lot of hairballs. Sometimes I add them into his daily wet food to get him to eat them when he turns his nose up.,Positive

She is definitely more energetic after just a week eating these treats.  Two cats could stand to gain some weight,hoping this will help aide in digestion.  I have noticed their stools seem to have hair in them that I never noticed before.  Maybe more fur is now being passed in the stools so not necessary to throw up fur balls?  I will keep buying this product, certainly can’t harm them.  Long haired cats get 2/day and the shorter haired cats get one/day for now.

I started giving one treat at a time to her during different times of the day.  Now she will eat all 3 at once.  The treats look soft, but they are a little hard.  My kittens have a hard time chewing the first treat I give them, they will drop it a few times.  The second and third treat they have no problems with oddly.

We tried many treats that worked okay, but eventually one cat would start vomiting them. Not so with these! No sensitive tummy issues at all, and these are their absolute favorite cat treats of all time! Their eyes get wide and light up every time I get them out! No more constipation and little rabbit pellets in the litter box. These cats are pooping like heavy-weight champs! And racing around like crazy cats instead of acting their age. Thank you!Suggestion:  Please make a multi-pack of several of these packets in a box, maybe 12, 16, or 20. It will keep them secure with less crumbling and make them easier to buy and store.

That's how much she likes them.Now, whether they help her with hairballs?  That I can't say.  She really never had much of a hairball problem to start with.

2260,B0CJZ69YMK,Accessory Shop Plus,5,tail waggin good,12/29/23,"Yo, fellow dog lovers! Just tossed my furry buddy one of these Dental Sticks, grain-free and chicken-flavored, from a 6.6-oz bag made for seniors, and let me tell you – it was an instant hit. This isn't just a treat; it's like a party for their taste buds and a high-five to their dental health.Firstly, the chicken flavor is legit. It's like these sticks have been seasoned with some kind of dog-approved magic. My old boy went for it like it was the best thing since belly rubs.The grain-free part is cool, especially if your pup's got a sensitive stomach. It's like they're keeping it healthy while still making it taste like a cheat day treat.Now, the dental aspect? Spot on. They're tough enough to give those chompers a good workout, helping to keep the tartar and plaque in check. It's like a gym session for their teeth, but way more fun.The size of the sticks is perfect for larger senior dogs. They’re substantial enough to keep them occupied but not too huge. It's like the perfect portion for a good munch without going overboard.And the bag? It's a decent size, meaning you're not running out after just a few treat sessions. It’s like having a ready stash of doggo happiness in your cupboard.",Positive

The large versions are about twice the size of the small version and suitable for my biggest dog or I could break them in half for my smaller guys.All of my dogs love these. They get either one or 1/2 a day depending on their size. They line up for one for their midmorning snack and can't wait to get them. Even my picky eater loves them.

I did notice he went back to it after awhile but normally he'll be in the crate until it is all gone. I suppose in one way that is good because it lasts awhile but on the opposite side of that, I do not want treats left in his crate.

I knew these sticks were large (about 6 inches each) but I figured I’d cut it in half and they could share one. Nope. I tried breaking it in two. My husband tried breaking it. We then tried cutting it. We could not cut it in half! So, I decided to let them each have one for a taste test. After a few minutes of gnawing, my old dog gave up and walked away. A few minutes later, my other dog yelped and dropped the stick. I think the hard ridge at the edge hit his gums causing pain so I took his away also. I’m giving two stars for ingredients and flavor but they were basically inedible by my dogs. I’d also be very careful of choking if your dog manages to bite off a small piece. A little softer and this could be a good product.",Negative

So I definitely feel thesecare a beter dental stick than others that break so easily and gone within seconds.  They do have a funky smell, but its not messy or sticky nor does it leave your couch, carpeting, ect smelly. My dogs certainty don't mind the smell. Just didn't smell like a nornal dog treat to me  (bacon,chicken peanut butter ect), but I'm not the one eating it. In this particular one there are only 7 sticks per bag.

What I appreciate most is that these dental sticks are grain-free, which aligns with my dog's dietary needs. Additionally, they are designed to support senior dogs' dental health, which is crucial as they age.The 6.6-ounce bag provides a good amount of treats to last for a while, and it's a convenient way to incorporate dental care into my dog's daily routine.

2320,B09R6CH93J,Deb Mericle,5,Perfect size for tiny mouths,8/1/23,"This is the perfect size for a teething puppy.It fits into their mouth great, helps them relieve the discomfort from teething, cleans their teeth, and keeps them occupied - which protects everything else in the house vulnerable to puppy teeth for a little while.I have one puppy, and another fully grown 12 year old dog.  I can’t actually give one of them a treat without giving both of them the same thing.  It seriously hurts their feelings if I try.So, the 12-year-old thoroughly enjoys these puppy treats also. :)This is a great price when you buy them in a three pack.

These sticks are kind of stinky, but she absolutely loves them. She wasn't doing as well with the rawhide twist sticks, she wasn't chewing them up enough before she tried to swallow the pieces, so I switched to these sticks.

We’ve been giving them one in the afternoon and one in the evening for teething and wind down time since they were 6 weeks and they’re 8 weeks now. They work great!

She is very hyperactive and bitey probably due to her teething, which has curbed her desire to bite everything within sight. If you have a bitey puppy, keep one of these on hand to have them chew on. In my opinion, they are a bit small, quite soft, and bendable. Because of that I always make sure to supervise my puppy while she's chewing on it just in case. It seems to last her a good amount, 1 per day for a 2-pound puppy. The recommendation on the back feels spot on so follow it.",Positive

2568,B01JONK8VO,SE Beutel,5,Slightly different than the old formula....,11/29/16,"My three dogs have been big fans of the old formula of these treats for quite a few years now. They are special favorites of my oldest dog (12) and pickiest eater. Because he is still extremely active, I try to give him as much glucosamine and chondroitin as I can. So the Get Naked Joint Health treats were a wonderful discovery. My dogs also enjoyed the other flavors in the line.When the formula was discontinued with the launch of the new grain free version, I was incredibly disappointed. Especially because the new treats had not reached the super-affordable price I was used to with the old formula (< $4) and the price on the discontinued formula was skyrocketing, which is typical of a market for a discontinued product. I was afraid that my dogs wouldn't like the new formula or that it would make them sick. I still don't understand why they needed to go grain free, considering that the grains in the old formula consisted only of rice and oats (which I didn't think were a big concern in doggie diets), but I am very glad the treats came back down to the extremely affordable price that my dogs and I love. Happily, the treats pass the doggie taste test and have yet to come back up the way they came.So without further ado, here is my comparison to the old formula for the treats:OUTSIDE: To start of, the packaging of the treats is very similar in wording and warnings, although the ingredient list does differ a bit. The package is orange instead of chartreuse, and since I don't particularly like either color it doesn't matter much that the bag got uglier. However, the development of the new packaging was clearly misguided. Perhaps in an attempt to make the packaging look like more ""natural"" products do in most marketing, the appearance of the bag has been ~softened~ to the point where things are very hard to read. Ditching the outline on the letters on the front was a big mistake with the gradient to light orange in the center, since it makes the letters look so fuzzy I thought my glasses were dirty or falling off my face. On the back, the crisp black lettering for the nutritional information was traded in for an even smaller font in white letters again. I can see that the smaller font was likely necessary because the packaging is now bilingual in English and French, but the choice of white is once again irritating to the eye. Even the NPIC logo and company information is so blurry that it is completely illegible.INSIDE: The grain ingredients, as well as tapioca starch, in the old formula have been replaced with potatoes. The rest of the ingredients listed are the same. The nutritional analysis is almost identical, with the exception that the Crude Protein minimum is 20% instead of 18%. The glucosamine per serving (32mg) and chondroitin sulfate (19mg) are the same, and now DHA is listed as well (4mg). The calorie content per treat remains at 26 kcal.The treats themselves are the same length and shape as the old formula, and have an almost identical amount of give as far as the hardness of the treat goes (which is good because the 10 year old rescue dog only has 5 teeth). They are not scary hard, but chewy enough to keep the dogs entertained for a few minutes and delicious enough to get the dogs excited when they see their favorite treat bag (which they know by shape and sound). Watching my dog chomp away, I would say that these new treats may be a bit tougher to bit through, although not too much.I was a little disappointed when I compared the new and old treats and found that the new ones are a bit slimmer than they used to be. It's not much, but considering that there were 2 less in the bag than you got in the old formula that was a bit sad. However, I noticed that the new treats are slightly heavier per piece, and the higher density makes sense with the extra chewing my toothless wonderdog was doing. The smell of the new formula is comparable to the old, slightly different but similar and nothing my dogs minded too much.If the treats continue to stay at this low price, I'll be very happy and hopefully my concerns over the formula switch will have been for nothing. I don't think I would pay more than $5 or so per bag, but that's partly because I can't afford much more right now as a pet indulgence and partly because I'm also just cheap (as much as I can be while still taking great care of my dogs). Also, I prefer to give the two older dogs at least one of these per day, since it makes them happy and gives them some extra vitamins that their little arthritic knees crave. At this price, I can do that.[...] I rely on reviews for my online purchases and want to do my part by making my reviews as helpful as I can. Thanks for reading!",Neutral

You can actually break them in half- they’re kinda bendy so it takes a little effort, but nothing major. I have one 15lb dog and one 20lb and I’ve gotten both chew sizes.

I love that they are low in calorie and do not contain rawhide which could cause a potential issue with my dog.  I am very cautious on the chews he is permitted to have since his health is my primary concern.  I actually have my little guy on a diet so I have been snapping these in half every night which he gets after his teeth brushing.  Every night he waits in the bathroom for me to wash my face and he patiently waits his turn to get his teeth brushed.  Yes that is correct I brush his teeth every single night before we go to bed and his reward is half of one of these chew sticks.  I never before have seen this brand in the local pet stores, I love the variety I am able to find on Amazons site I wanted these in particular since my pup has 2 grade 3 patellas anything that is good for his joints I will buy for him to help him stay healthy.
