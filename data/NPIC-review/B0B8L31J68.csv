Even though the rings were made for adult dogs, they kept my two puppies busy for quite a while and took care of their ""itchy"" teeth; so these are perfect for teething puppies. The dental rings don't have a strong smell like bull pizzle or pig ears, additionally, they are free of many common allergens and the rings did an excellent job of reducing doggie breath, especially my oldest dog's ""guess what I found in the backyard"" breath. These chicken rings are definitely going into our treat rotation.The Bottom Line: The 7-count bag of N-Bone Chicken Flavor Adult Dog Dental Rings sells for $9.88, which is just $1.41 per treat which is less expensive, per treat, than the bulk treats at my LPS.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Dental-Chicken-Flavor-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB0B8L31J68%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhN05JBzoA%252BbLNAMsd9faTDCwLt2qNLoihuCnrXSlDqSPAAAAAGXT8ccAAAAB%26reviewId%3DREUT05HGX82OV&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Helpful","One person found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hN05JBzoA%2BbLNAMsd9faTDCwLt2qNLoihuCnrXSlDqSPAAAAAGXT8ccAAAAB&reviewId=REUT05HGX82OV","Report","0","There was a problem loading comments right now.

I like the ingredients (mostly rice flour and gelatin, no weird ingredients), and they take a bit more time to chew than the usual dental chews I give them.  These did not cause any upset stomachs.The ingredients of these n-bones are pretty similar to those of Twistix, which I've been giving my dogs for years and years as well as the dogs for whom I dogsit.  So far no one has gotten an upset stomach from those, and I'm sure they'll be fine with these as well.  I like that there are no artificial colors in these!  Dogs do not care how their treats look!They're a bit big for my 20lb dog, although not if you ask him.  I was hoping I'd be able to break these rings in half, but they're way too hard to break.

He's not a picky eater, but there are some treat flavors he won't eat. It didn't take him long to  make this ring-shaped chew disappear, maybe a full minute if that.  The package may say it's for 'strong' chewers, but it sure doesn't seem like it. Maybe it's also based on dog size?  Our American Bulldog is a big chonker, and he chewed through this treat like it was nothing more than a marshmallow. Our little ten pound Min Pin mix took a lot longer to devour her piece, but she also didn't have any trouble biting through the treat. Price here on Amazon is certainly better than the box box pet stores, where these bags sell for at least twice the price (at least around here in NY well outside of the city). We've bought these rings before as our A.B. loved their puppy teething rings when he was that age. They also have a pumpkin flavor, but we've yet to come across ANY dog - be it our own or that of friends or family or even shelter pups - that like that flavor.  But the chicken flavored chewy rings, like these, are quickly taken after a cursory sniff. Because of the higher calorie content, our dog only gets one or two a week and only on the days when we know he will be getting extra exercise.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Dental-Chicken-Flavor-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB0B8L31J68%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhGF8AwaLovb5osb9%252BEPcZh8mMvupKwpQi%252Bqo%252Fu7nHsMRAAAAAGXT8c0AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2SWUDWR0N0I93&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Helpful","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hGF8AwaLovb5osb9%2BEPcZh8mMvupKwpQi%2Bqo%2Fu7nHsMRAAAAAGXT8c0AAAAB&reviewId=R2SWUDWR0N0I93","Showing  comments","0","There was a problem loading comments right now.
