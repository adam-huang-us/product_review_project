216,B09FQ9VZNP,se,1,Dry and crumbly,7/20/23,Just received my order and the treats inside are dry and crumbly. Bottom of the bag just has treats that have become powdered. Not sure if this is how the product is supposed to be or not or if this is just old treats. The best by date is September 23 but it doesn’t say when it was manufactured. I feel like I’m being sent old almost expired products so they can clear inventory. I would think companies would want to send out the best product so that customers will keep coming to buy. This kind of product being sent creates a 1 time purchase and never again. I’m additionally both cats just looked at it and walked away. Mind you these cats when they see a treat they never say no. So disappointed. I wish I was sent new fresh product. Disappointed,Negative,Product Quality Issue

243,B09FQ9VZNP,ChiefB & SweetieBoo,3,My Cat Thumbs His Nose At This,11/28/21,"Every cat is an individual, and they know what they like and what they don't. Although many cats seem to love these Biteables, my senior cat would have nothing to do with it. I tried a single treat whole, then broken in half, and he just sniffed it and walked away each time. The next morning I even broke one in half and hid it in the middle of his wet cat food, which he normally inhales the minute I put it in his bowl. He ate around the treat halves and left them in his otherwise empty bowl. He loves chicken, which is the primary ingredient in these treats, but apparently that wasn't enough to entice him. In people years my cat is 88 years old, so it's not like he's going to change his food preferences at this stage of his life. The ""chicken and tuna recipe"" on the package is a bit misleading, since the tuna is only ""natural tuna flavor"" and not the real deal, and the same with the ""natural fish flavor."" I am still rating this product 3 stars even though my cat didn't like it because I think the L-lysine, taurine, and probiotics probably would have been good for him if he had been willing to eat these treats.",Negative,Palatability
244,B09FQ9VZNP,Cathy,3,Soft treats for your cst,10/24/21,So I was really hoping our cats would love these soft treats so I could feel good about giving treats that had some health value to them. Unfortunately only 1 of our 3 cats would remotely touch them and it was only once.  I’m sure it’s just that our cats are picky about their food and treats.  They seems to be good quality with good packaging. Our cats just prefer the junky treats to the healthy ones. Go figure.,Negative,Palatability
245,B09FQ9VZNP,Joe Smart,2,Both of my cats hate the flavor,10/30/21,"Different cats have different tastes so normally I wouldn't give a product two stars just because my cats didn't like the flavor but I really think it's warranted and possibly even generous in the case of Get Naked Essential Health Biteables because both of my cats really love treats but they absolutely hate these.The package boasts that Get Naked Biteables provide essential health benefits including lysine and probiotics and that the #1 ingredient is real chicken--although that last one doesn't actually mean anything because they could be saying that the highest quality or most expensive ingredient is chicken, not necessarily that chicken makes up the largest actual portion.  In any case, these are not cat food--they are cat treats.  With cat food, strong health benefits are definitely something you want to look for but with treats the number one most important thing is flavor.  Cats should be thrilled when you pull out the package and they see that you are about to give them a treat.I have two cats.  They both love treats.  They both ate exactly one of these Get Naked Bitables treats and will not touch them again.  They absolutely hate the flavor which means these aren't much of a treat as far as my cats are concerned.  Get Naked Biteables might well be very nutritious but they neglected the single most important thing that every cat treat needs which is great taste.",Negative,Palatability

310,B007RW7CJQ,Michelle,3,Caution; Throw Out When It Gets Hard!,4/14/21,"So, I've been getting these for my dog a while now. She normally scarfs them down over the course of an hour, but the latest time, she decided she wanted to keep one end of it to put in her little treat stash. About a week later, she grabbed it, we played fetch with it (it was hard like rock now) and she ate it; I thought nothing of it because it still chewed apart. Later that day, about 12 hours, she threw up a large amount pieces that weren't digesting. Even though they weren't splintering, the pieces were just sitting in her stomach like a bunch of rocks. They were getting smoother and I'm sure still digesting, but they were also causing obvious pain to her and she was unable to eat anything else while they were still clanking around in her stomach.I'd still absolutely recommend these to dog owners, but with much more caution and awareness. Once the texture isn't the soft-ish bendable feel it was out of the bag, its time to toss it. I got lucky she threw them up, and that none of the harder bits did splinter, but its important to be aware of things like intestinal blockages or damage that can occur from treats that appear fine.",Negative,Health Issues

Oddly though, the last time I purchased 2 bags of the chicken flavor ones they looked darker, almost black. My ferret would not eat them. I already purchased the bacon flavor for him awhile ago and he would not eat those either. In the provided picture, the first bag (left) are the chicken ones I am referring to that I just bought and he won't eat. The bag in the middle is my last ""good"" ones I bought and the last time they shipped the ones he loved. Note that these are way lighter in color than the ones on the left. The bag on the right are the bacon ones he won't eat. So, in conclusion, the chicken bag ones on the left look exactly like the bacon ones in the bag on the right. I think they may have put the bacon flavor ones in the chicken bags by mistake.

After a couple more tries, he started eating them, but didn’t seem too enthusiastic.Another issue: I ordered 3 bags to take advantage of a 3-for-the-price-of-2 checkout coupon. I got 3 bags, but only 2 contained the full 2.5 ounces of treats. The 3rd bag is about a third full, despite being in the same packaging as the other two. It clearly doesn't contain the listed 2.5 ounces. It's not that big a deal, considering I paid for 2 and got a little more than 2 bags' worth, but still, it makes me question if the company's not playing fast and loose in other ways.And, as others have noted, despite the Amazon listing, there's nothing on the product's packaging that specifically says these treats are good for a urinary tract health diet.

The packaging makes it look like it's a meaty chew, but its actually a firm clear-ish gelatinous stick, I'm assuming its a juice or or artificial flavoring?

I laid it on the doormat thinking she might go for it eventually, and I had to go back to work and forgot about it. Over the next couple hours, not one but two of my neighbor's dogs came by (up to my door, where they stare intently at my cat through the screen). The NEXT DAY, after which who knows what else (including y'know, bugs and other wildlife) could have eaten the blasted thing, there it was, whole, on my door mat.I'm not positive what is in this, but whatever it is, it must be really, really unappetizing.",Negative,Palatability

2501,B01JONKI9Q,sarcazm,1,Dog likes them but I am not a fan,7/14/19,"Whenever he eats one of these treats he ends up constipated for the next 24 hours or so, which throws off not just his schedule but everyone else's as well.  I wonder if it might have to do with the seeds.  He doesn't behave like he has an upset stomach or anything but it definitely isn't worth extra-long walks where nothing happens, as well as being woken up in the middle of the night to go on extra walks to also have nothing happen.  Will not be buying these again.",Negative,Health Issues
2503,B01JONKI9Q,Jon,1,Made both dogs sick,5/17/19,"We have two golden retrievers.  We gave these to them, the first one got sick 9 times.  We weren't sure if it was these, so we tried a second day, our bigger one got sick again and our smaller one got sick 5 times.  We removed these from the diet and the dogs were 100% fine.  Both dogs rarely get sick, but our bigger one, has only got sick once in his life, and this was the worst. Won't purchase these or anything from this brand again.",Negative,Health Issues
