The 4 month old stray we adopted over a month ago who is having a hard time kicking a pretty bad kitty herpes flare loves these and he is the one who I needed these for.  We have been giving him 500mg lysine twice a day as the vet directed and keeping him on antibiotics to prevent a bacterial side infection in his lungs, but he has not been getting any better.  Within two days of giving him these he has less rattling in his lungs, this has been the only improvement in his condition we have seen in over a month.  I did the math and for 6 chews there is only about 70mg of lysine, and since we have been giving him high doses of lysine for over a month the lysine is obviously not the ingredient in these chews that is helping.  I am therefore left to assume it is the probiotic.  While he is still far from recovered this has given me hope and I am going to look into a more broad spectrum probiotic and see if we can get him over this flare and onto a preventive regime which I think these chews will make be a part of.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Biteables-Natural-Essential%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09FQ9VZNP%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhKDujdD38sRqB05gvwUx7slnVLDZxBuxKprjUJVs2yfCAAAAAGXT1A4AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3BO68WMTJ083X&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Helpful","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hKDujdD38sRqB05gvwUx7slnVLDZxBuxKprjUJVs2yfCAAAAAGXT1A4AAAAB&reviewId=R3BO68WMTJ083X","Showing  comments","0","There was a problem loading comments right now.

In any case, these are not cat food--they are cat treats.

Cats should be thrilled when you pull out the package and they see that you are about to give them a treat.I have two cats.  They both love treats.  They both ate exactly one of these Get Naked Bitables treats and will not touch them again.  They absolutely hate the flavor which means these aren't much of a treat as far as my cats are concerned.
