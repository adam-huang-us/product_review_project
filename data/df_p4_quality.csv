24,216,B09FQ9VZNP,se,1,Dry and crumbly,7/20/23,Just received my order and the treats inside are dry and crumbly. Bottom of the bag just has treats that have become powdered. Not sure if this is how the product is supposed to be or not or if this is just old treats. The best by date is September 23 but it doesn’t say when it was manufactured. I feel like I’m being sent old almost expired products so they can clear inventory. I would think companies would want to send out the best product so that customers will keep coming to buy. This kind of product being sent creates a 1 time purchase and never again. I’m additionally both cats just looked at it and walked away. Mind you these cats when they see a treat they never say no.

These used to be soft, waxy, fatty treats. Now there mostly dust and crumble with the slightest pressure. One of my ferrets won't eat them and shows no interest (but usually loves these) and I don't really feel comfortable feeding them to either because they look expired or poorly formulated. I don't know what happened. These are available with the usual consistency through Petco. Additionally, Amazon/seller won't accept return or replacement of this item in particular.

114,549,B014KLSBDW,FGC,1,Bacon Flavor in Chicken Packages,10/29/22,"I have purchased these many times as my ferret loves their chicken flavor treats. Oddly though, the last time I purchased 2 bags of the chicken flavor ones they looked darker, almost black. My ferret would not eat them. I already purchased the bacon flavor for him awhile ago and he would not eat those either. In the provided picture, the first bag (left) are the chicken ones I am referring to that I just bought and he won't eat. The bag in the middle is my last ""good"" ones I bought and the last time they shipped the ones he loved. Note that these are way lighter in color than the ones on the left. The bag on the right are the bacon ones he won't eat. So, in conclusion, the chicken bag ones on the left look exactly like the bacon ones in the bag on the right. I think they may have put the bacon flavor ones in the chicken bags by mistake. Now I am afraid to order more as I can't be sure they will be correctly packaged and Amazon will not accept returns for them. If you know ferrets, they can be very fussy regarding food and treats so I hope someone that can do something to fix this problem will see this review!",Negative,Product Quality Issue,Color Issue

I did notice he went back to it after awhile but normally he'll be in the crate until it is all gone.

We then tried cutting it. We could not cut it in half! So, I decided to let them each have one for a taste test. After a few minutes of gnawing, my old dog gave up and walked away. A few minutes later, my other dog yelped and dropped the stick. I think the hard ridge at the edge hit his gums causing pain so I took his away also.
