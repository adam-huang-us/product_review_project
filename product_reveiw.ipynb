I gave my pup one of the chicken flavored chew sticks this morning.  She chewed the stick in about 10 minutes and appeared to really enjoy it.  However, as soon as she finished, she immediately started to whine and cry, letting me know she wanted to get out of her crate.  I opened the crate and she ran to get a drink of water and headed right for the door.  I opened the door and let her out to her soiling area where she made a quick pee before making a very loose, watery poop!! I am extremely disappointed in this product and regret purchasing a 3-pack of the 6 oz. che sticks.  What a waste of money and an unpleasant experience for my young pup.\n",

      "Comment: These teething sticks would be great for small dog puppies or puppies who are not intense or extreme chewers. My 10 week old lab chewed through and ate this stick within 3 minutes of giving it to him. So if you do get these teething sticks for your pups, just be sure to watch them closely. It says 3 sticks daily for 16 to 25lb puppies, but I would not recommend that, as they are super thin and could potentially be a choking hazard. They do not have a strong smell as well.\n",

At first, both cats would devour them just like the other kind. However, after a few days, the pickier of the two would begin to vomit after eating a few of the health treats, and even the other one would no longer inhale them like he used to.2 days later, the fussy eater will not touch the health treats at all, and will also no longer touch the furball treats - shame, thought I'd finally found something she'd like, but I guess it was not meant to be. Might give it a few days and see if she wants to try at least the furball treats again, but it does look like the health treats are a lost cause for both cats.\n",

And I’ve learned they want the exact same treat.I am not strong enough to break this ring in pieces. So I give one to my older dog. She breaks it up. The little dog grabs a piece and runs.Of course all the other pieces get eaten by my 12 year old dog.Since I don’t have the flexibility to give them smaller pieces, it gives the older dog much more of this treat at one time than I would prefer.Both of my dogs devour this in record time.  No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household. Or maybe if you had an older dog who did not want every single thing the puppy gets… and vice versa.But, for me and my family, it isn’t quite working out the way I hoped.It is a good product.

The first four ingredients are:  Rice Flour, Vegetable Glycerin, Gelatin, and Water.  Meat should be the first ingredient in my opinion.I bought my pup some Pur Luv Chicken Jerky, and she goes nuts for those.  The ingredients are:  Chicken Breast, Vegetable Glycerin, Salt...that's all of the ingredients!If you're dog likes Puppy Teething Sticks, I'm glad.  They are affordable and look like they will last long.  But if they don't, try Pur Lov Chicken Jerky.\n",

I now get chews labeled for puppies. This last about 45 minutes of focused chewing. I think the ingredients are good as neither dogs have any digestive reactions from them.

They’re a great size for her current size of 4-5 pounds.Do not leave your puppy unattended with these.  I would say that my puppy is an aggressive chewer.

He has a problem with eating things he's not supposed to and I was looking for something to help relieve his chewing on bad things. I always hated how they didn't have any good chew things for cats because I can attest that chew cats exist! Well my cat didn't want anything to do with these chews... The packaging makes it look like it's a meaty chew, but its actually a firm clear-ish gelatinous stick, I'm assuming its a juice or or artificial flavoring? I won't be buying these again, but I'm glad this is on the market because I'm sure some cats would love it, just not mine. It's well packaged and is resealable. I'd like to suggest an alternative that I found that my cat actually likes. It's Dogswell Happy Hips Salmon or Chicken Jerky. They're made for dogs but they're just dehydrated meat with no hormones or additives so it's good for cats too, and your cat may like it if it doesn't like these because it's actually meat!\n",

I had to break the treats into half because they were just unusually big for my 8-lb Ragdoll. Unfortunately, she hates chicken flavor, so I could only give her 2 treats a day for 2 days max. The second day she threw up because she just didn't like it and I couldn't manage to give it to her the third day. I wish there was a fish or beef flavor of this digestive health treats since those are her favorite flavors. The scent was really strong too, so if your cat hates chicken flavor as well, they're definitely not going to eat this. I suggest giving like 2 treats in their food bowl and burying the scent with wet cat food.\n",

I always cut them into severalpieces, and sometimes they were a little hard and I just splashed into the bag with a little water andsealed it up again, and then they had softened up enough to cut.  The sticks in this latest shipmentwere so hard that I was unable to soften them up, even after several infusions of water into the bag.This is absolutely unacceptable, particularly since they are freshness dated \"by Feb 25, 2025.  Mydentist told me that one of her dogs actually broke a tooth on these dental sticks!!These are supposed to be beneficial for dogs, and not so hard they are dangerous.I am sending the three bags that were in my last shipment to the company, since they are notreturnable to Amazon, but I am disappointed that Amazon is carrying something so obviouslynot up to their standards.I have been purchasing these dental sticks for years for my small Havanese dog.

I gave my pup one of the chicken flavored chew sticks this morning.  She chewed the stick in about 10 minutes and appeared to really enjoy it.  However, as soon as she finished, she immediately started to whine and cry, letting me know she wanted to get out of her crate.  I opened the crate and she ran to get a drink of water and headed right for the door.  I opened the door and let her out to her soiling area where she made a quick pee before making a very loose, watery poop!! I am extremely disappointed in this product and regret purchasing a 3-pack of the 6 oz. che sticks.  What a waste of money and an unpleasant experience for my young pup.\n",

She vomited about 4 times during the night.  The next day she had watery diarrhea.  As the day went on it got bloody. By the night fall of day two it will full on blood coming out. Took her to the emergency room, she got treated for digestive issues.  With treatment she improved within hours, however when I wrote to Quado they flat out denied it was due to the bone and even tried to \"silence\" me with a package of treats worth $20 and wanted to me sign non disclosure statement paperwork.  Needless to say they also refuse to pay for any of the medical bills.\n",

I always cut them into severalpieces, and sometimes they were a little hard and I just splashed into the bag with a little water andsealed it up again, and then they had softened up enough to cut.  The sticks in this latest shipmentwere so hard that I was unable to soften them up, even after several infusions of water into the bag.This is absolutely unacceptable, particularly since they are freshness dated \"by Feb 25, 2025.  Mydentist told me that one of her dogs actually broke a tooth on these dental sticks!!These are supposed to be beneficial for dogs, and not so hard they are dangerous.I am sending the three bags that were in my last shipment to the company, since they are notreturnable to Amazon, but I am disappointed that Amazon is carrying something so obviouslynot up to their standards.I have been purchasing these dental sticks for years for my small Havanese dog.

I am very happy with it, you pay more but it worth the money and your puppy will thank you.Cons:1. crumbly and poop consistency2. Get messy overhand/ fingers3. Not the ideal ingredients.My advice, move to better brands that offer freeze-dried single ingredients. I am also trying Amazon brand WAG and excited to try the beef liver product.  I tossed it away after use it briefly, as it is best for my dog.\n",

I gave my pup one of the chicken flavored chew sticks this morning.  She chewed the stick in about 10 minutes and appeared to really enjoy it.  However, as soon as she finished, she immediately started to whine and cry, letting me know she wanted to get out of her crate.  I opened the crate and she ran to get a drink of water and headed right for the door.  I opened the door and let her out to her soiling area where she made a quick pee before making a very loose, watery poop!!

      "Comment: Based on both cats loving the purple furball soft-treats made by the same company, I thought I'd give the health soft-treats a try. At first, both cats would devour them just like the other kind. However, after a few days, the pickier of the two would begin to vomit after eating a few of the health treats, and even the other one would no longer inhale them like he used to.2 days later, the fussy eater will not touch the health treats at all, and will also no longer touch the furball treats - shame, thought I'd finally found something she'd like, but I guess it was not meant to be. Might give it a few days and see if she wants to try at least the furball treats again, but it does look like the health treats are a lost cause for both cats.\n",

      "Comment: We have a multiple dog household.A 12-year-old, and a three month old Australian shepherd/border collie mix.Well, when we give one a treat, we have to give both of them a treat. And I’ve learned they want the exact same treat.I am not strong enough to break this ring in pieces. So I give one to my older dog. She breaks it up. The little dog grabs a piece and runs.Of course all the other pieces get eaten by my 12 year old dog.Since I don’t have the flexibility to give them smaller pieces, it gives the older dog much more of this treat at one time than I would prefer.Both of my dogs devour this in record time.  No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household. Or maybe if you had an older dog who did not want every single thing the puppy gets… and vice versa.But, for me and my family, it isn’t quite working out the way I hoped.It is a good product. I wish it would’ve worked out better for us. :-)\n",

What I didn't realize is that his sharp little baby teeth can chew this apart within minutes, leaving small pieces that are big enough to choke on.  I think I was expecting too much from this chew as my puppy is an aggressive chewer. Might be perfect for more \"chill\" puppies.

It hasn’t improved.These teething rings are too large and too hard for small breed puppies. However, they would probably be great for larger breeds.So!

      "Comment: My cat is a 1 year old Turkish Van who is a big chewer. He has a problem with eating things he's not supposed to and I was looking for something to help relieve his chewing on bad things. I always hated how they didn't have any good chew things for cats because I can attest that chew cats exist! Well my cat didn't want anything to do with these chews... The packaging makes it look like it's a meaty chew, but its actually a firm clear-ish gelatinous stick, I'm assuming its a juice or or artificial flavoring? I won't be buying these again, but I'm glad this is on the market because I'm sure some cats would love it, just not mine. It's well packaged and is resealable. I'd like to suggest an alternative that I found that my cat actually likes. It's Dogswell Happy Hips Salmon or Chicken Jerky. They're made for dogs but they're just dehydrated meat with no hormones or additives so it's good for cats too, and your cat may like it if it doesn't like these because it's actually meat!\n",

The second day she threw up because she just didn't like it and I couldn't manage to give it to her the third day.

I literally gave this to my 4-month-old 40-lb boxer/hound puppy while I was in a meeting, thinking it would keep him busy but 5 minutes in he had already eaten one of the four sticks.So points for flavor and SoMe durability but I won’t be able to consider it a keep-him-busy chew; more like a slightly drawn out snack.\n",

But instead of being very firm but chewy, both bags were filled with rings that were completely rigid and hard. My pup couldn't even chew them.

He has a problem with eating things he's not supposed to and I was looking for something to help relieve his chewing on bad things. I always hated how they didn't have any good chew things for cats because I can attest that chew cats exist! Well my cat didn't want anything to do with these chews... The packaging makes it look like it's a meaty chew, but its actually a firm clear-ish gelatinous stick, I'm assuming its a juice or or artificial flavoring? I won't be buying these again, but I'm glad this is on the market because I'm sure some cats would love it, just not mine. It's well packaged and is resealable. I'd like to suggest an alternative that I found that my cat actually likes. It's Dogswell Happy Hips Salmon or Chicken Jerky. They're made for dogs but they're just dehydrated meat with no hormones or additives so it's good for cats too, and your cat may like it if it doesn't like these because it's actually meat!\n",
