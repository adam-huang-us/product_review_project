He would mow them down like a wood chipper! Lol They are a bit small or skinny so good size for even teacup size dogs like even below 3lbs( had a Yorkie that was 2 1/2lbs, Hadley, before i got Viserys, my Shih Tzu)but I would suggest that you watch or moderately supervise your dog while he/she eats them. I have heard reports that some dogs have choked or got them stuck in their mouths and throats. So to be safe, make sure your dog is in eyes view of you while he treats himself to these. They are apparently tasty to them. I started giving him the peanut butter ones for a bit of variety and now he won‚Äôt eat any more of both flavors. Lol I may have just gave them to him a bit too much and he got tired of them too quickly but everything seemed fine before the peanut butter ones. Came to find out he had been hiding them away in the folds of his bed. I go to clean his bed out and i find all these sticks! He was eating them at first seemed to love them.

The bones are soft enough to bend without breaking. We purchased them for our 4-lb puppy. It looked like she had a cigarette (kinda funny!) and it lasted maybe 10 minutes. Then, we lost the bag somewhere in the house. Now that she's 8-lbs, it looks like she can eat the whole bag in one hour. The bones are about 1/4-inch wide. So, we are cutting the treats in half and putting them outside for the squirrels, who might find them too small too. To be fair, there are a good amount of treats in the bag. Our puppy was attracted to the flavor right away. But she is too big to enjoy its chewing fun and value.

I don't think they do much for satisfying the need to chew, as there are better options for that, but they are a nice treat.  There are puppy teething rings made by this same company which last a bit longer - but they also cost more and you don't get very many in a package.  I use those when I have them for the same purpose of settling my puppy down at bedtime, but they also don't do much to satisfy the need to chew, despite the name of the product.

Many people also use them as a treat as they do get eaten very quickly and some would argue that they do not help for teething. I have two King Charles Cavaliers and used these for both when they were puppies and I also used them for the litter of pups we just had. For a small breed dogs and young pups these do work great for teething. I gave them to the pups when they started getting teeth and they were unable to ""eat"" them yet but they loved the taste and it did help them with teething. Once they got older and were able to eat them it was more of a reward yes but it still helped with their back teeth which take the longest time to ""pop out"". The momma and daddy dogs even tried to steal them because they are so yummy! I also like these because they are edible and are much healthier to eat then raw hides. I recommended these to all of the new owners of our pups!","2 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-111150-Puppy-Teething-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00061URQA%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhG93zpGUd66OifmJUd9EeBnIGLqquwg1GTedTm3i7o08AAAAAGXT448AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2HO3ZJVMDYVRH&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hG93zpGUd66OifmJUd9EeBnIGLqquwg1GTedTm3i7o08AAAAAGXT448AAAAB&reviewId=R2HO3ZJVMDYVRH","Showing  comments",""

I ended up buying more online. These were much harder (probably older) but she loves playing fetch with them.  We play for like an hour a day.  They slide and roll beautifully and are light enough that although she is a small cat she can easily carry them, and even jump onto my bed/couch with them.
