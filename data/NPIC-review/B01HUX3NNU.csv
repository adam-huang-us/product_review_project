They are excellent on their own or meal toppers. They are very soft so easy on his super senior teeth (or lack thereof lol), sometimes we crumble them on top of his wet or dry food to get him more excited to eat. They also have seemed to help keep his #2 movements nice and even as he had been having some gastric issues and inconsistencies. One thing to note is bc of their hairball remedy ingredients you are only supposed to give them a few a day (for his 9 lbs weight it’s 3x day).

We've tried MANY cat treats over our 16 years together (well, I've bought them and he tried them), and he's never loved any like he loves these! He is a longhaired cat and, as a bonus, they have really reduced the amount of hairballs he gets quite substantially, so it's a win/win. Now he will actually meow and ""ask"" for a treat whenever a family member goes to where we keep them, and my daughter has even taught him the ""trick"" of standing on his hind legs and reaching up to ""tap the bag"" with his paw as she holds it in order to ""earn"" a treat. lol","5 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Furball-Relief-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01HUX3NNU%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhPEDghraEiqhzvojPZJLaoSJrOlVrATDOoz%252FSpAr8zADAAAAAGXT8tgAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1VLWU6BGCQR2T&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPEDghraEiqhzvojPZJLaoSJrOlVrATDOoz%2FSpAr8zADAAAAAGXT8tgAAAAB&reviewId=R1VLWU6BGCQR2T","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

About 1/4 of the treats remain whole. The rest are big crumbs or just cat treat dust (sandy texture). Amazon did provide me with a refund at my request.I will sprinkle the crumbs in with her kibble or on top of her wet topper so it doesn’t go to waste.

They're a soft treat and smell alright. He has had less hairballs since I started giving him these so I think it works pretty good.

I have noticed their stools seem to have hair in them that I never noticed before.  Maybe more fur is now being passed in the stools so not necessary to throw up fur balls?

We tried many treats that worked okay, but eventually one cat would start vomiting them. Not so with these! No sensitive tummy issues at all, and these are their absolute favorite cat treats of all time! Their eyes get wide and light up every time I get them out! No more constipation and little rabbit pellets in the litter box. These cats are pooping like heavy-weight champs! And racing around like crazy cats instead of acting their age. Thank you!Suggestion:  Please make a multi-pack of several of these packets in a box, maybe 12, 16, or 20. It will keep them secure with less crumbling and make them easier to buy and store. We go through around 4 packs a month for 2 cats.","7 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Furball-Relief-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01HUX3NNU%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhD0Wxnpbt1dvsHOYdcvCbLJ%252FIidAvErinxdKI4i4IyLVAAAAAGXT8uEAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR27ETI55E1ZPX5&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hD0Wxnpbt1dvsHOYdcvCbLJ%2FIidAvErinxdKI4i4IyLVAAAAAGXT8uEAAAAB&reviewId=R27ETI55E1ZPX5","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

The other 2, one being a 6th month old kitten who eats almost everything would not even lick the treats. My female kitty got sick about a hour later.

She gets much more excited about these compared to the name brand treats that I normally give her. I bought these because she had recently thrown up the biggest hairball I'd ever seen in my life, even though I've been brushing her every single day for the past 4 months. It's still too early to tell if these will help with the hairballs but so far it's been good.The only downside is that she should only get 3 treats per day based on her body weight.

He's the least finicky of my 3 cats but he won't touch these. He loves the Get Naked Urinary treats. Maybe it's the difference in texture. These treats are rather large but are soft & chewy/crumbly. I've tried breaking them up & mixing with his dry food & the bits get left in the bottom of the bowl. My other 2 cats (including the queen of finicky) gobble them down so it's not a total loss. The one that won't eat them is a shorthair but he has a heavy undercoat & also grooms his longhaired sister so I know he'll have hairball issues at some point. I guess I'll have to try something else for him. As for the others that will eat the treats, no sign of hairball issues since I started feeding these so I'm good with that.
