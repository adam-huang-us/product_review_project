I read an article somewhere about this product that made me look into it further. Note here, I am all about natural raw feeding, integrative vet care, wholesome ingredients and positive training and keeping up with new ideas like Reiki for animals. (It really works!).I bought the small chews for my standard size dogs (50 - 70 pounds) because I don't give large treats but prefer to parcel them out. Perfect size. After their breakfast they each get a chew stick and they love them. I feed them in their crates and the floor gets a bit slimy because they break off bits and shove them around but with crate feeding (the rare times the dogs use the crates anymore) the floors get cleaned up anyway. You can smell the cinnamon which I know is good for breath and other ailments in humans as well. One of my concerns with these dental type chews in the past has been the possibility of blockages and these appear to not pose that risk to my dogs, being narrow and chewy and not overly hard with ridges, kind of like a star shaped stick. I only give one a day per dog in the morning because I don't want to upset tummies and I want to keep these a special treat even though these treats have a job. I broke one into fourths and gave them to a friend with a Shi Tzu and suggested one piece per day for him since he is tiny. He loved them. So a little goes a long way. Between the Naked Chew in the morning and the Virbac Enzymatic toothpaste in the evening my dogs teeth are really improving and they are all seniors who had some residue I was looking to improve upon. Teeth are looking shiny white like me after a trip to my favorite dental hygienist. I recommend the combination. The raw diet does contribute of course. These are a safer, healthier dental chew than anything else I've seen with ingredients I am comfortable with offering my dogs in reasonable portions. I recommend supervising your dog at first and considering the size of your dog and the size of the treat and perhaps breaking the treat into smaller portions if you have a smaller dog and offering that either two a day or depending on the sensitivity of your dog's digestion. I order in quantity to reduce cost. I think this is a great product.","7 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDigestive-Health-Dental-Sticks-6-2-Ounce%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB003AYCVVY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhHvJHuns%252BdtTshmG2dZ7sMW0sHhhBPYRAPCl2lxWdK6PAAAAAGXT8SsAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR16RNVC2ZEADI5&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHvJHuns%2BdtTshmG2dZ7sMW0sHhhBPYRAPCl2lxWdK6PAAAAAGXT8SsAAAAB&reviewId=R16RNVC2ZEADI5","Showing  comments","",""

One, they love them.  Two, the chew sticks offer healthy benefits in addition to tasting good.  Because one of my pooches is 110 lbs and the other is only 18 lbs, I have to buy them in both the large and small size.Besides making my pups happy, what are the benefits?  For starters, the chewing action is supposed to help whiten their teeth by removing plaque and tartar.  Also, these Gut Health Treats contain beneficial bacteria, or probiotics, that help maintain a healthy digestive system by protecting the gut against harmful bacteria and pathogens. Soluble and insoluble dietary fiber slows down the metabolism of carbohydrates and helps keep their bowel movements firm and regular.  And every dog owner who picks up after their pets knows that the state of the poo is important.Part of the reason that my dogs love these is because they're longer lasting than a typical dog cookie.  It generally takes my dogs at least a few minutes to finish one of these.  The large chew sticks contain 98 calories each and the small chew sticks contain 18 calories each.Ingredients:  Organic brown rice powder, rice powder, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch, oat fiber, chicken, natural chicken flavor, organic flaxseed, calcium carbonate, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), parsley, chia seed, cinnamon, ginger, peppermint, bacillus coagulans.Guaranteed Analysis:  Crude Protein (min.) 18.0%, Crude Fat (min.) 2.0%, Crude Fat (max.) 3.5%, Crude Fiber (max.) 6.0%, Moisture (max.) 15.0%, Ash (max.) 3.0%, Sodium (max.) 15 mg, total bacillus coagulans 6.3 million CFU.","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hGeOp3qnyGdk7vGK7Zn%2BP3yLOktjz1efvJ3hkkeKluj3AAAAAGXT8SsAAAAB&reviewId=R3G1K2GKKW7O0S","3 people found this helpful","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","Report"

With all the sever health issues reported from carrageenan ingestion in humans, you'd think that pet companies like this would remove it from their ingredients and replace it with another safer choice.  Until the company removes this ingredient, I cannot recommend.  It's a shame because these are great dental chews that are not hard on the teeth and my dog loves them.","4 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDigestive-Health-Dental-Sticks-6-2-Ounce%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB003AYCVVY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhN820bryTfRe5O9hqBu1HcrFojETR6d0vuacQM%252F1Ye8qAAAAAGXT8SsAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR26ZYMIJOLM2BI&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hN820bryTfRe5O9hqBu1HcrFojETR6d0vuacQM%2F1Ye8qAAAAAGXT8SsAAAAB&reviewId=R26ZYMIJOLM2BI","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif",""
