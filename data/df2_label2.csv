2315,2315,B09R6CH93J,Victoria Buono,4.0,Wish I went with the rings instead,2023-07-31,The sticks get lost easier than the rings would. Puppy is teething so I can give him this to stop biting what is wrong to bite. He enjoys the taste. Seems like it takes forever to finish one. They get gross or lost before I’ve seen him finish a single one. He loses interest in it quickly. It’s hard for him to hold. Makes me kinda nervous that he could choke on the shape.,negative,Negative,Health Issues
