The little dog grabs a piece and runs.Of course all the other pieces get eaten by my 12 year old dog.Since I don’t have the flexibility to give them smaller pieces, it gives the older dog much more of this treat at one time than I would prefer.Both of my dogs devour this in record time.  No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household. Or maybe if you had an older dog who did not want every single thing the puppy gets… and vice versa.But, for me and my family, it isn’t quite working out the way I hoped.It is a good product.

Part of it is definitely that he can sink his teeth into it multiple times (kinda like a hard wax texture?), part of it is the shape due to how he tosses it, and another must be the flavor.  Thankfully it doesn't smell as bad as the bully stick nor the cod skins we have.  The cod skins do not offer the ""teeth sinking"" feeling this does, and while bully sticks do they stink so much.I would note that these rings do leave a sticky hard residue, likely from the rice flour or maybe the gelatin as it reminds me of how my hands feel after getting dried over cooked rice on clothing. His beard and paws feel crunchy afterwards and this can also end up on you, clothing, and furniture. We find this a very fair trade for the length of time this has entertained our landshark puppy though when compared to the smells of bully sticks and codskins (or the left over scales). Some hot water on a wash rag can clean it up easily without stains.","10 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Teething-Blueberry-Multicolor-Regular%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08KL4M5RK%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhLI%252FaniWsfHv1AvrPD0oP%252BW032E%252Bpb%252BIjKmOrZU7gyfIAAAAAGXT4EgAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2YZHU8HBOG7RR&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Helpful","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hLI%2FaniWsfHv1AvrPD0oP%2BW032E%2Bpb%2BIjKmOrZU7gyfIAAAAAGXT4EgAAAAB&reviewId=R2YZHU8HBOG7RR","Showing  comments","0","There was a problem loading comments right now.

I made do by cutting those in half until we used them all up, but the tiny puppy ones are just the right size.When she was younger, a ring would keep her occupied for a good 30 mins or more. Now at eight months of age with all her permanent teeth either fully in or growing in, it takes her maybe 15 minutes to finish one off. Still a good busy-time treat while I'm on Zoom calls or as a reward for really good behavior, but I do wish they were a little bit longer lasting.These are also made in the U.S., which is important to me after so many imported pet treats have caused health issues.
