She is very hyperactive and bitey probably due to her teething, which has curbed her desire to bite everything within sight. If you have a bitey puppy, keep one of these on hand to have them chew on. In my opinion, they are a bit small, quite soft, and bendable. Because of that I always make sure to supervise my puppy while she's chewing on it just in case. It seems to last her a good amount, 1 per day for a 2-pound puppy.
