One will throw up if he gets more than 2-3 at one time, another looks at them and gives me a blank look as if asking “What did you just try to pawn off on me?”, and then there’s the third one that is all-the-treats-all-the-time. So I have a hard time finding treats that they will all like or at least two out of three. So what did they think of these?Smell (that’s mostly me): On the mild side. Didn’t really smell like chicken to me.Hard/soft: Very soft. Two of the cats seemed to eat them okay, but the one that’s missing most of her teeth had trouble with them.Taste (that’s them): they seemed a bit dubious and I think that might be down to the mild smell. While they did eat them, the toothless one was the slower of the three to jump on them.Overall: I like that this product is made in the USA and it’s for all life stages since ours range from 4-11yo. I’ve also found that they do seem to enjoy cranberry when it’s in their foods, which is always a bonus for me (and them). And at the listed price, it’s about on par with other similar products out there. In looking at the brand, I also see that there’s other flavor options, which I intend to investigate.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Biteables-Natural-Chicken%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09FQDFF3Q%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhGxHCaCO81n6kEgXpQLkRY%252BrCl700ONqFZAliVvu%252Fx3BAAAAAGXT1L4AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2RBX7XAT13YER&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Helpful","One person found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hGxHCaCO81n6kEgXpQLkRY%2BrCl700ONqFZAliVvu%2Fx3BAAAAAGXT1L4AAAAB&reviewId=R2RBX7XAT13YER","Report","0","There was a problem loading comments right now.

One will throw up if he gets more than 2-3 at one time, another looks at them and gives me a blank look as if asking “What did you just try to pawn off on me?”, and then there’s the third one that is all-the-treats-all-the-time. So I have a hard time finding treats that they will all like or at least two out of three. So what did they think of these?Smell (that’s mostly me): On the mild side. Didn’t really smell like chicken to me.Hard/soft: Very soft. Two of the cats seemed to eat them okay, but the one that’s missing most of her teeth had trouble with them.Taste (that’s them): they seemed a bit dubious and I think that might be down to the mild smell. While they did eat them, the toothless one was the slower of the three to jump on them.Overall: I like that this product is made in the USA and it’s for all life stages since ours range from 4-11yo. I’ve also found that they do seem to enjoy cranberry when it’s in their foods, which is always a bonus for me (and them). And at the listed price, it’s about on par with other similar products out there. In looking at the brand, I also see that there’s other flavor options, which I intend to investigate.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Biteables-Natural-Chicken%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09FQDFF3Q%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhNrc5%252FieTzyE0py950Ya%252BWN7VrAaNfjyAUuOB%252F%252BbHhQWAAAAAGXT1NAAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2RBX7XAT13YER&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Helpful","One person found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hNrc5%2FieTzyE0py950Ya%2BWN7VrAaNfjyAUuOB%2F%2BbHhQWAAAAAGXT1NAAAAAB&reviewId=R2RBX7XAT13YER","Report","0","There was a problem loading comments right now.

At first, both cats would devour them just like the other kind. However, after a few days, the pickier of the two would begin to vomit after eating a few of the health treats, and even the other one would no longer inhale them like he used to.2 days later, the fussy eater will not touch the health treats at all, and will also no longer touch the furball treats - shame, thought I'd finally found something she'd like, but I guess it was not meant to be. Might give it a few days and see if she wants to try at least the furball treats again, but it does look like the health treats are a lost cause for both cats.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Biteables-Natural-Chicken%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09FQDFF3Q%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhDPnEH9Mr6wDv4Z8wJ2mGzO%252BMpVSzU2VRVI6cPozQ0J4AAAAAGXT1NAAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2RHZAPLDT9YHD&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Helpful","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hDPnEH9Mr6wDv4Z8wJ2mGzO%2BMpVSzU2VRVI6cPozQ0J4AAAAAGXT1NAAAAAB&reviewId=R2RHZAPLDT9YHD","Showing  comments","0","There was a problem loading comments right now.
