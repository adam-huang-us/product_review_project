She normally scarfs them down over the course of an hour, but the latest time, she decided she wanted to keep one end of it to put in her little treat stash. About a week later, she grabbed it, we played fetch with it (it was hard like rock now) and she ate it; I thought nothing of it because it still chewed apart. Later that day, about 12 hours, she threw up a large amount pieces that weren't digesting. Even though they weren't splintering, the pieces were just sitting in her stomach like a bunch of rocks. They were getting smoother and I'm sure still digesting, but they were also causing obvious pain to her and she was unable to eat anything else while they were still clanking around in her stomach.I'd still absolutely recommend these to dog owners, but with much more caution and awareness. Once the texture isn't the soft-ish bendable feel it was out of the bag, its time to toss it. I got lucky she threw them up, and that none of the harder bits did splinter, but its important to be aware of things like intestinal blockages or damage that can occur from treats that appear fine.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Pupper-Nutter-Peanut-Butter%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB007RW7CJQ%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhP30CoFx3jmlSrrIrdUEHWnlshbmcJqIJnyFURy079BvAAAAAGXT8MAAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR14QYFFDFQBXYW&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","20 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hP30CoFx3jmlSrrIrdUEHWnlshbmcJqIJnyFURy079BvAAAAAGXT8MAAAAAB&reviewId=R14QYFFDFQBXYW","Report","Showing  comments","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
