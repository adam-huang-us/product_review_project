They are special favorites of my oldest dog (12) and pickiest eater. Because he is still extremely active, I try to give him as much glucosamine and chondroitin as I can. So the Get Naked Joint Health treats were a wonderful discovery. My dogs also enjoyed the other flavors in the line.When the formula was discontinued with the launch of the new grain free version, I was incredibly disappointed. Especially because the new treats had not reached the super-affordable price I was used to with the old formula (< $4) and the price on the discontinued formula was skyrocketing, which is typical of a market for a discontinued product. I was afraid that my dogs wouldn't like the new formula or that it would make them sick. I still don't understand why they needed to go grain free, considering that the grains in the old formula consisted only of rice and oats (which I didn't think were a big concern in doggie diets), but I am very glad the treats came back down to the extremely affordable price that my dogs and I love. Happily, the treats pass the doggie taste test and have yet to come back up the way they came.So without further ado, here is my comparison to the old formula for the treats:OUTSIDE: To start of, the packaging of the treats is very similar in wording and warnings, although the ingredient list does differ a bit. The package is orange instead of chartreuse, and since I don't particularly like either color it doesn't matter much that the bag got uglier. However, the development of the new packaging was clearly misguided. Perhaps in an attempt to make the packaging look like more ""natural"" products do in most marketing, the appearance of the bag has been ~softened~ to the point where things are very hard to read. Ditching the outline on the letters on the front was a big mistake with the gradient to light orange in the center, since it makes the letters look so fuzzy I thought my glasses were dirty or falling off my face. On the back, the crisp black lettering for the nutritional information was traded in for an even smaller font in white letters again. I can see that the smaller font was likely necessary because the packaging is now bilingual in English and French, but the choice of white is once again irritating to the eye. Even the NPIC logo and company information is so blurry that it is completely illegible.INSIDE: The grain ingredients, as well as tapioca starch, in the old formula have been replaced with potatoes. The rest of the ingredients listed are the same. The nutritional analysis is almost identical, with the exception that the Crude Protein minimum is 20% instead of 18%. The glucosamine per serving (32mg) and chondroitin sulfate (19mg) are the same, and now DHA is listed as well (4mg). The calorie content per treat remains at 26 kcal.The treats themselves are the same length and shape as the old formula, and have an almost identical amount of give as far as the hardness of the treat goes (which is good because the 10 year old rescue dog only has 5 teeth). They are not scary hard, but chewy enough to keep the dogs entertained for a few minutes and delicious enough to get the dogs excited when they see their favorite treat bag (which they know by shape and sound). Watching my dog chomp away, I would say that these new treats may be a bit tougher to bit through, although not too much.I was a little disappointed when I compared the new and old treats and found that the new ones are a bit slimmer than they used to be. It's not much, but considering that there were 2 less in the bag than you got in the old formula that was a bit sad. However, I noticed that the new treats are slightly heavier per piece, and the higher density makes sense with the extra chewing my toothless wonderdog was doing. The smell of the new formula is comparable to the old, slightly different but similar and nothing my dogs minded too much.If the treats continue to stay at this low price, I'll be very happy and hopefully my concerns over the formula switch will have been for nothing. I don't think I would pay more than $5 or so per bag, but that's partly because I can't afford much more right now as a pet indulgence and partly because I'm also just cheap (as much as I can be while still taking great care of my dogs). Also, I prefer to give the two older dogs at least one of these per day, since it makes them happy and gives them some extra vitamins that their little arthritic knees crave. At this price, I can do that.[...] I rely on reviews for my online purchases and want to do my part by making my reviews as helpful as I can.

You can actually break them in half- they’re kinda bendy so it takes a little effort, but nothing major. I have one 15lb dog and one 20lb and I’ve gotten both chew sizes.

I'm glad these are relatively low calorie so i can reward the pupsters several times a day.","Report","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Health-Dental-Sticks%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01JONK8VO%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhJdArlQurFkQW%252BnrtWaJpWapXLLwmIf2dqjVvl6AWraXAAAAAGXT8pQAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRXNQ7V8IWY683&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Showing  comments","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hJdArlQurFkQW%2BnrtWaJpWapXLLwmIf2dqjVvl6AWraXAAAAAGXT8pQAAAAB&reviewId=RXNQ7V8IWY683","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"
