Just tossed my furry buddy one of these Dental Sticks, grain-free and chicken-flavored, from a 6.6-oz bag made for seniors, and let me tell you – it was an instant hit. This isn't just a treat; it's like a party for their taste buds and a high-five to their dental health.Firstly, the chicken flavor is legit. It's like these sticks have been seasoned with some kind of dog-approved magic. My old boy went for it like it was the best thing since belly rubs.The grain-free part is cool, especially if your pup's got a sensitive stomach. It's like they're keeping it healthy while still making it taste like a cheat day treat.Now, the dental aspect? Spot on. They're tough enough to give those chompers a good workout, helping to keep the tartar and plaque in check. It's like a gym session for their teeth, but way more fun.The size of the sticks is perfect for larger senior dogs. They’re substantial enough to keep them occupied but not too huge. It's like the perfect portion for a good munch without going overboard.And the bag? It's a decent size, meaning you're not running out after just a few treat sessions. It’s like having a ready stash of doggo happiness in your cupboard.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Dental-Grain-Free-Chicken%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB0CJZ69YMK%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhAuETor8dTdeuagmQy0YabNqM1nLYqcIQWqcG8Ll4OX4AAAAAGXT01oAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3FICDPR599P21&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hAuETor8dTdeuagmQy0YabNqM1nLYqcIQWqcG8Ll4OX4AAAAAGXT01oAAAAB&reviewId=R3FICDPR599P21","Showing  comments","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I did notice he went back to it after awhile but normally he'll be in the crate until it is all gone.

We then tried cutting it. We could not cut it in half! So, I decided to let them each have one for a taste test. After a few minutes of gnawing, my old dog gave up and walked away. A few minutes later, my other dog yelped and dropped the stick. I think the hard ridge at the edge hit his gums causing pain so I took his away also. I’m giving two stars for ingredients and flavor but they were basically inedible by my dogs. I’d also be very careful of choking if your dog manages to bite off a small piece.

They do have a funky smell, but its not messy or sticky nor does it leave your couch, carpeting, ect smelly. My dogs certainty don't mind the smell.

Additionally, they are designed to support senior dogs' dental health, which is crucial as they age.The 6.6-ounce bag provides a good amount of treats to last for a while, and it's a convenient way to incorporate dental care into my dog's daily routine.
