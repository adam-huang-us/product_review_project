She gets herself so worked up that she's just beside herself. These have been great for her as a distraction when she's getting to that point. It's not just the ingredients that make this calming. Gnawing on one of these lets her get some of her nervous energy out in a safe way, and I think it's been very effective. She struggles with separation anxiety and falls apart when I leave, but if I give her one of these first and then sneak out the door she does a lot better.
