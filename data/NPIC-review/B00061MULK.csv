One of them played with these sticks for a little while but didn't seem to figure out they were chewable, even when I stuck them in his mouth. Oh well, he's a little dumb anyway.The other cat LOVES them. She needs her stick fix every day. She gets one at 6pm and the other around midnight, and she knows it - when the time comes she'll go to the kitchen counter and start meowing and begging for them. Sometimes she plays fetch with the stick, but most of the time we throw it for her, she runs after it, grabs it and starts chowing down. She even figured out how to stick one end into the high pile carpet so that she can keep it stable while she gnaws on the other end. They seem to be doing a good job of keeping my girl cat's teeth clean; we have to give dental treats and water additives for the other cat. We've been subscribed to these sticks for over a year now and she goes through about three packs a month.So your mileage may vary with these sticks. From my sample size of 2, there's a 50% chance of stick addiction and 50% chance that they'll totally flop. Even so, I have to give them 5 stars because of how much my girl loves them. If they ever discontinue these, I'm going to have a very unhappy cat on my hands.Oh, and the first few times you give these to your cat, keep a close eye on them. My cat has never choked in her 1 year plus of eating these every day, but she has taken bites that were too large and immediately vomited them up after - I guess the large chunks didn't sit well in her stomach. If you have a very small kitten, they may choke.","23 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-111198-Cat-Chew-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00061MULK%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhOVL2m6vbNYCwP8bBxmv7wc7BxUDPn80%252FQ%252B5yd6ve5hFAAAAAGXT4YkAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1UALXYCGD407I&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOVL2m6vbNYCwP8bBxmv7wc7BxUDPn80%2FQ%2B5yd6ve5hFAAAAAGXT4YkAAAAB&reviewId=R1UALXYCGD407I","Showing  comments",""

He chew through 2 sticks but the 3rd time I tried to give him one he turned away from it. I gave one to the dog to show him they're the same thing but time after time he still turned away from it.I do know cats don't normally find ""chew"" toys necessary since cats don't typically chew in the same way dogs do. So perhaps this bone broth stick is just too hard for cats in general. But i think tbr taste is fine bc other animals in the house see it as a treat. in the end I turned to just finding some some what mildly freezed dried meat treats for his chewy-like behavior.Dogs however love the bone broth stick. I gave the rest of the bag to a toy poodle owner and her 2 dogs loved them. So 3 stars for decent dog treats that has the word cat on the bag.

This has been a lifesaver for me because my cat has a G.I. issue and I have realize that when she starts trying to chew everything in my home office while I’m working, that it’s because her tummy is aggravating her. I now leave the sticks in my desk and when she starts chewing on my artificial plants and papers and pens, I offer her a stick and she now comes running. The downside is that she can’t hold it on her own without me holding it. However, it absolutely does the trick  and stops her from Destroying my house and eating something that she is not supposed to eat. She’s also fine with just less than one stick per day.It’s surprisingly sit well on her stomach as well and that makes me happy, because there’s not a lot of treats out there that she can have with a diet that she’s on. I don’t think of these like a cat treat, but more of a chew therapy for a cat that needs to chew on some thing. Hope this helps people in similar situations. Best advice, offer it to your cat when you see them chewing because they are more likely to try it and once they try it they may like it more. Again I would not offer this as just an occasional every day treat, as there are probably better ones out there if your cat does not have stomach issues.","20 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-111198-Cat-Chew-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00061MULK%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhO8Qa5%252Fn4beYgXpTf2tHKR7MLTUaapouHvxbxSGQvJ96AAAAAGXT4YkAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2X3V8HR4BV9X3&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hO8Qa5%2Fn4beYgXpTf2tHKR7MLTUaapouHvxbxSGQvJ96AAAAAGXT4YkAAAAB&reviewId=R2X3V8HR4BV9X3","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

He chews on everything he can get his mouth around. We haven't found much that will discourage it. These have been a welcome addition to the house. We've been sticking them near things that he likes to chew on, and evidently they're a bit more enticing because he's been leaving the other stuff around the house alone. He seems to really enjoy biting bits off so there are little pea-sized nodules peppered around the area but he's no longer putting himself at risk by chewing on electrical cords so I consider this an absolute success. Plus it seems that it's fun to play with because even the ones he's knocked loose from the places we've wedged them he'll roll around on and kick.

He is a 13 week main coon/bengal tabby mix, and he still hasn't mastered how to chew on the stick but he loves the flavor and is definitely interested in them. The stick themselves ARE soft enough for a cat to break the stick down with bites and chunks. If you do own a cat that is a chewer, then you may want watch them, just so they don't choke. I'm glad that it is easy for the cat to chew but not too soft that Mr. Biggles looses interests or eats them and moves on. Considering that there are enough chew bones in a 3.37 oz package, being that they are 4"" sticks each, I feel that they will last several month. Mr. Biggles is teething, but that much of a chewer. Being that these are all natural and made in the USA, this makes the product an even more handsome buy. ***Edit Review**** My. Mr. Biggles eats the stick in 4 minutes or less. He mastered this by 7 months old. They are his 2nd favorite to chew on, 1st is bison lung. He has clean teeth and no bad breath. I moved on to bully and raw hide, it lasts longer.","7 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-111198-Cat-Chew-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00061MULK%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhJvTpE8LYaAa6ii8nvkhOlYI%252BLz2y6J33rIjmjG9qX1FAAAAAGXT4ZEAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3IMBVJ5TCDI7L&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hJvTpE8LYaAa6ii8nvkhOlYI%2BLz2y6J33rIjmjG9qX1FAAAAAGXT4ZEAAAAB&reviewId=R3IMBVJ5TCDI7L","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

Fantastic idea for teething kittens. My kitten won't use any teething toys, but he loves these!I don't really understand how someone can complain about there being more wheat and corn than chicken in this. They are supposed to be hard to wear down. I can't see this being possible with chicken being the primary ingredient. The formulation is perfectly right for what the product actually IS. Your cat isn't going to sit there and eat the entire thing in one sitting, so I'm pretty sure a little more wheat and corn than chicken isn't going to kill them.If you don't like the idea of your cats chewing on anything that isn't pure meat, you're not going to find anything like this usable. If your cat is allergic, you already know they are because you'll have to purchase special food for them, as well. N.y cats eat natural food, where meat is the primary ingredient, and there's still some veggies and grains in there, because in general they are GOOD for them and make up part of a well balanced diet.If your cat has allergies, though, you'll be happy to know there are catnip sticks on Amazon, too, which are literally sticks that have been broken off from the plant. Problem solved.This product though doesn't deserve the bashing another reviewer here gave it. My cats love it, they love their food too for that matter (they were the ones that picked it), and they're healthy. That's all I can really ask for.","11 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-111198-Cat-Chew-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00061MULK%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhLOPqMux7k0vElhqBI%252FJZ07JB61gskh18nTdwjFSQTwJAAAAAGXT4ZMAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR22P4DKK9TKLBM&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hLOPqMux7k0vElhqBI%2FJZ07JB61gskh18nTdwjFSQTwJAAAAAGXT4ZMAAAAB&reviewId=R22P4DKK9TKLBM","Showing  comments",""

My cat is a biter and LOVES to chew on a good (iPhone) cord or paper. I tried buying him a chicken flavored plastic dog bone, but I think it was too big for him to put around his mouth and actually chew on. The first time I tried to give this to my cat, Stan, he didn't really know what to do with it. He licked it a little bit and was just over it. I thought it was a failure. Then one day, he was play biting at me on the couch and I put the bone in place of my finger and he started chewing it. It took a LONG time of me holing the bone/treat while he chewed away for him to finish the first one, I was also a little concerned when it got broken down into a smaller size that it could be a choking hazard, but it's been fine. He just started his second treat and this time he knew what he was doing and at half of it in one sitting. I think it was a successful purchase for me, but I'm sure it's totally dependent on the cat.","One person found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-111198-Cat-Chew-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00061MULK%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhFmW83m6l%252Bx11ds9fwPKGEKf3qpSSrkni6fYXZKoHwsmAAAAAGXT4ZMAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3CBEN2DNCY1IC&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hFmW83m6l%2Bx11ds9fwPKGEKf3qpSSrkni6fYXZKoHwsmAAAAAGXT4ZMAAAAB&reviewId=R3CBEN2DNCY1IC","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

But if you also have a dog they won't be wasted...","One person found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-111198-Cat-Chew-Treats%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00061MULK%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhIaf6X21qBC%252BfDSC2wNbb303gw0x0brPNzodFIjeyW7EAAAAAGXT4ZMAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRM021U5EXIZVV&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hIaf6X21qBC%2BfDSC2wNbb303gw0x0brPNzodFIjeyW7EAAAAAGXT4ZMAAAAB&reviewId=RM021U5EXIZVV","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

So I gave him his first treat and timed how long it took him to eat it. One minute and fifty-six seconds. He was a super determined and single-minded about it, and he is a large cat so I am sure that made it easier for him. It didn’t take him nearly as long as I had hoped, but it kept him occupied longer than anything else I have found, and let him take out some of his need to chew on something he is actually allowed to chew.

Keep close tabs on string like objects, Coat all power cords with ""Bitter Apple Spray"", and give him a N-Bone Cat Chew Treat!  Your cat doesn't like them? Try dipping it in butter.  Try holding it for him while he chews it up.  The cat chews are meant to be pliable.  Too dry?  Just wrap in a moistened paper towel and keep in the fridge for 24 hours.  They soften right up.  My cat goes on the hunt for something to chew on.  He sniffs the power cord smelling for one that is not sprayed with bitter apple.

I'd like to suggest an alternative that I found that my cat actually likes. It's Dogswell Happy Hips Salmon or Chicken Jerky.
