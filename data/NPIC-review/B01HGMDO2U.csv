Six years ago I decided to adopt cat. I didn’t know which one yet just that I wanted a cat in my life. I went to a local shelter and found one that I liked a lot. When I talked to the clerk there she told me that the little guy I liked was really sick, and that their vet couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him. I got nervous about the costs associated with an undiagnosed illness, and when I made my thoughts known the clerk said “he’s not the cat for you.” I gave her this look of “excuse me?” And she continued saying, “when it’s your cat, you’ll know. And you won’t care what’s wrong or how much the medical bills might be, you’ll just know.” She suggested I go check out a couple other places and that if my heart was truly set on this little guy I could come back for him. Turns out she was right. He wasn’t the little guy for me, although I’m sure he found a very happy home. I went to another shelter that day and when I walked in, I turned to the cat room (it was very small and had no door) and started to go in. I remember the shelter was really loud. It was small so there wasn’t much of a barrier between the dogs and cats. But over all the chaotic noise I just heard this heartbreaking meow. I looked at the back of the room and there was this little grey floof meowing at the top of his lungs, standing up on his hind legs just staring at me. I immediately went over and got him out of the cage, and didn’t put him down again until we got home. I didn’t even ask if he’d had health issues, because that clerk was right. I didn’t care. Little did I know I chose a floof (named Jasper) that would end up with some serious health issues, costing around $6000 for the hospital stay and surgery, and expensive prescription food thereafter. Jasper had crystals in his bladder that he was unable to pass through his urethra. He almost died when it was at its worst, and even though it was suggested to me to put him down, I told the vet to try anything he could to save him. The surgery has a 50% success rate which is not great, but it was a success for Jasper. However, he now needs some special care to ensure he stays healthy. Although the prescription food helped immensely, I noticed he was still having digestive issues, and has had a couple of flare ups with his bladder. I tried so many different things but nothing really worked until I found these random cranberry treats on amazon. I figured, what the heck. Might as well. And they were a godsend. Not only is Jasper OBSESSED with these treats, but they help him so much! As long as I consistently give him these treats he doesn’t get bladder flare ups, and he throws up a lot less (now it’s just the occasional hairball for which I started using Loxatene). In general they just keep him much healthier and happier, and they’re ten times better than the royal canine prescription treats. A few months back they stopped selling these, and immediately Jasper started having some issues again. I’m so glad they’re back in stock, and I hope they stay that way. If your cat has urinary tract issues, I am begging you, try these! It is absolutely and by far the best product for kitty UT issues on the market. Quality ingredients, and proven to work. And for the record, I am not being paid or sponsored for this review. I just truly truly believe in this company and these treats after everything Jasper and I have been through. Anyway, if you’ve gotten this far, thanks for reading, and try the treats.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Urinary-Crunchy-Cranberries%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01HGMDO2U%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhHMb7qXnvczVnjlt9xrZ82ufWLn2V9gM0R8xuCRE%252BwZDAAAAAGXT5YwAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1UV5AP9NHBZ2R&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Ready for a long story?","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHMb7qXnvczVnjlt9xrZ82ufWLn2V9gM0R8xuCRE%2BwZDAAAAAGXT5YwAAAAB&reviewId=R1UV5AP9NHBZ2R","Well you’re here reading so I guess you are.

As he's getting on his years and UTIs are an issue for male cats I try to give these to him daily. At 16 lbs he gets about 12 of these per day, I throw them across the room and he screams joyfully as he flies upwards, getting several feet of air. Sometimes one gets under a bookcase and then he goes mad trying to pry his precious out from under the thieving piece of furniture. I don't dare go near the bag when it's not Treat Time as he will get all riled up and becomes utterly unbearable.The weird thing is initially when I first got these he did not care for them. I didn't give him any for a few weeks and suddenly he developed a taste for them, I'm not sure what kitty crack they put in these things.My other cat does not care for these. One sniff and she turns to me with this annoyed face like I'm wasting her valuable cat-time.So your cat's reactions to this will vary (every kitty is an individual and she/he has different preferences). If they don't like it, try again later or give it to another fellow cat owner to enjoy.Edit: I have updated my review from 4 stars to 5 stars.It's 10 months since my previous review and my cat still loves them! And they help keep his weight down as we have made a game where I shake the bag (and he gets all crazy because he has the exact sound of the bag memorized) before throwing the treat for him to catch/find. I throw him a couple throughout the day so he gets his 9-12 minimum and they keep him active and healthy. The treats are also a nice small size so he doesn't have to struggle at all (senior kitties sometimes have teeth issues so he tries and gives up on the bigger treats that require chewing). I hope the company never changes the formula!","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Urinary-Crunchy-Cranberries%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01HGMDO2U%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhP5wiBEsfeVmdcAPGKzTAV0Sm94THKNc3NYYG91q8pOWAAAAAGXT5YwAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3217R4EVGGTJW&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","23 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hP5wiBEsfeVmdcAPGKzTAV0Sm94THKNc3NYYG91q8pOWAAAAAGXT5YwAAAAB&reviewId=R3217R4EVGGTJW","Report","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

This means out with the old treats (which were likely okay), and in with treats for cats with FLUTD.Our cats totally ignored these treats. Even when hungry, they hardly even sniff them, and have not eaten a single treat. So, one can infer that at least some cats don't like these alleged ""treats"". From that, one can safely conclude that for those cat owners, this is $6 wasted.Yes, cats can be persnickety, and maybe change their minds about things. Our cats are somewhere in the middle of that continuum, but when it's dinner time, and the treats aren't even sniffed at, I think that's a good sign that the treats ... aren't ""treats"".I should also mention that we've tried many different brands of treats down through the years, and none have been so roundly rejected as these. So, you can take your chances buying these. They are roughly double the price of typical treats.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Urinary-Crunchy-Cranberries%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01HGMDO2U%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhBohpIMQaNHF2omYHDe70BbzO7Srw3gOXoMf8VA2BtS9AAAAAGXT5ZYAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2H1M3QFC6T2JX&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","One person found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hBohpIMQaNHF2omYHDe70BbzO7Srw3gOXoMf8VA2BtS9AAAAAGXT5ZYAAAAB&reviewId=R2H1M3QFC6T2JX","Report","Showing  comments",""

She has recurrent UTI's and has regular visits to the vet for antibiotic courses to treat the infections, but she has generally been very low energy and strains to pee quite often. I bought these treats as a last ditch effort to see if the cranberries could help keep the acidity up in her urinary tract to prevent bacterial growth because that's a home remedy my mom brought up for when people get UTIs as well. After a week of feeding her these treats and not changing her diet/any other significant lifestyle factors, her personality and mood and urinary habits have transformed significantly, and I'm so happy she's doing better. I didnt realize that there were also so many vitamins in these treats too, and I think they've also helped make a big difference.

My cat's on a strict urinary tract health diet and I supplement his regular food with treats throughout the day.He didn't go for these at first, which was an early bad sign as he usually gobbles up treats. Ingredients say these have chicken as the primary ingredient, which he loves. So it's curious why he wouldn't take to them. After a couple more tries, he started eating them, but didn’t seem too enthusiastic.Another issue: I ordered 3 bags to take advantage of a 3-for-the-price-of-2 checkout coupon. I got 3 bags, but only 2 contained the full 2.5 ounces of treats. The 3rd bag is about a third full, despite being in the same packaging as the other two. It clearly doesn't contain the listed 2.5 ounces. It's not that big a deal, considering I paid for 2 and got a little more than 2 bags' worth, but still, it makes me question if the company's not playing fast and loose in other ways.And, as others have noted, despite the Amazon listing, there's nothing on the product's packaging that specifically says these treats are good for a urinary tract health diet. Are they really? Can you believe the ingredient listing at all?Considering these issues together, it makes me question if I can trust the company and their product claims. It all seems shady. Therefore I don't think I'll ever order these again for my cat.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Urinary-Crunchy-Cranberries%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01HGMDO2U%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhE2YGtTYWT0J27s2%252BtzU0wU0ewZeJSVdodyKQ04R8DgKAAAAAGXT5ZYAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRRIHC3UXE1NGB&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","5 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hE2YGtTYWT0J27s2%2BtzU0wU0ewZeJSVdodyKQ04R8DgKAAAAAGXT5ZYAAAAB&reviewId=RRIHC3UXE1NGB","Report","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

My cat never had any urinary problems before eating these, and she has none now either. The treats themselves are crunchy, small and heart shaped. My cat doesn't love these (like she does some others... as she's ""tempted"" by another kind). She is though happy to have something different than just her regular food. These are well priced, although I'd like to make a suggestion to you all. I have purchased a bag of dry food, different than her regular, daily kibble (I bought it here, on Amazon). I use it as a ""treat"" for her, and whatever I give her, I subtract the same amount from her daily ration. This way, she thinks that she's getting her treats, but won't put on extra weight (which so many cats do, for this reason alone). It'll also save ALOT of money considering, for instance that a five pound bag of dry food would equal more than 20 bags of treats. Whoa, that's alot of money! My daughter turned me on to this idea, and I think she's pretty amazing for thinking of it. I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy these, especially if their cat does have urinary issues. But, I can't say that they would have any effect on it. Possibly checking with your cat's vet might be a good idea.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Urinary-Crunchy-Cranberries%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01HGMDO2U%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhLpyLMiPMKEso5s8mwzdUKr%252FgNSKKRK0BAsfEdHXPdRTAAAAAGXT5ZgAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR86GQMTLO7DR9&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","One person found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hLpyLMiPMKEso5s8mwzdUKr%2FgNSKKRK0BAsfEdHXPdRTAAAAAGXT5ZgAAAAB&reviewId=R86GQMTLO7DR9","Report","Showing  comments",""

This is a journey to good health for the cat and we hope these treats help in this adventure.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Urinary-Crunchy-Cranberries%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01HGMDO2U%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhAuOKFb6j5W6Pq1KSjG%252BeA%252Fax7BhZjFvTa2Ki6IVmYBBAAAAAGXT5ZgAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2EOIZSJWZ3JMM&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","One person found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hAuOKFb6j5W6Pq1KSjG%2BeA%2Fax7BhZjFvTa2Ki6IVmYBBAAAAAGXT5ZgAAAAB&reviewId=R2EOIZSJWZ3JMM","Report","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

Honestly, I didn't think he'd make it. It's a multi-cat household, so I didn't catch his problem until it was dire. We already had a cat fountain, but added water dishes throughout the house and immediately switched to Purina Pro Plan for urinary health (he refuses wet food). One weird trick that worked to increase hydration was to sprinkle water onto cat grass before letting him nibble it. I ordered these treats because he loves snacks and already felt deprived from the new food and miserable from the crystals. I was told eating smaller meals more frequently helps control urine pH. He loves them! I have to hide the bag so he won't bite into it and help himself. I can't say whether the snacks help, but they don't appear to hurt. He's on the mend and is even playing with the other cats. However, if you're on the fence about these treats, it's true they are a love or hate thing. While the cat with urinary issues loves these, every other cat rejects them. I don't know whether there is something in them the one cat instinctively senses will help or he's just less picky. The size of the treats and crunch factor seems about the same as other treats. The recommended daily amount for a small cat is 5-6 per day (twice that for a large cat), so while the package is small, I think they will last a while. The ingredient list looks healthy, so I feel good giving them to him.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGet-Naked-Urinary-Crunchy-Cranberries%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB01HGMDO2U%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhNSsmLZDAa7oPX2qqNjtYmah3NLEGEFDBGcUldLRLZ30AAAAAGXT5ZsAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRM7XF3E1WL6E9&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","97 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hNSsmLZDAa7oPX2qqNjtYmah3NLEGEFDBGcUldLRLZ30AAAAAGXT5ZsAAAAB&reviewId=RM7XF3E1WL6E9","Report","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

He's been to the emergency vet more times than I can count due to this issue. This cat is a carb addict and refuses wet food, so I have to settle with a kibble designed for urinary tract health. Recently, I decided to get him on a VERY high, very expensive quality dry kibble. After several weeks on the new food and after multiple tests with a pH strip, I started noticing the pH of his urine became very basic instead of acidic, which is where it needs to be. I decided I'd try these to see if it helped so I could keep him on the new food because I adore the ingredients.
