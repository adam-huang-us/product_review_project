My dogs are not puppies, so I don't use these for ""puppy teething"". I give them pieces of these purely for healthy bedtime treats. I use kitchen shears to cut the rings into several pieces (each piece about an inch long).Then at bedtime, when my doggies are done eating for the day, they each get one piece. I feel the chewing motion helps clean their teeth and release healthy enzymes in their mouths. I love that the ingredients in these are so healthy and natural.And best of all my pups love their nighttime routine. They go out to potty, then race up on the porch and through the door to get their nightly pumpkin treats. Then time to snuggle with mommy & daddy!Oh, one more thing....once in awhile I get a bag where the rings are extra hard and brittle. When that happens, I just wet a clean paper towel, ring it out, then put it in the bag with the treats. I leave it sealed that way for about 24 hours. After that, they are more pliable and my kitchen shears cut through much better. And they are less brittle for my dogs' teeth that way too.","6 people found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Puppy-Teething-Pumpkin-Flavor%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00X6THK2S%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhCcpgEenEeAskmofWpbPxdzO98gZazJmVXZkCAfZVYcNAAAAAGXT4UcAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2252E1GYDU57M&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hCcpgEenEeAskmofWpbPxdzO98gZazJmVXZkCAfZVYcNAAAAAGXT4UcAAAAB&reviewId=R2252E1GYDU57M","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

I could tell something was wrong and I thought he was choking. Stuck my finger down his throat- didn't feel anything, felt his throat nothing was protruding.  He was distressed.  Was putting on my shoes and grabbing my purse to run to the vet when I grabbed a flashlight- turned him over pried his mouth open and the darn piece was stuck to the roof of his mouth.

I've bought 3 bags now, which is becoming expensive so I may try to make some pumpkin treats myself since she doesn't really need the hardness of these for teething anymore.At first I was worried about her choking when she gets a chunk broken off, but she chews pretty thoroughly before she swallows.

Just, wow. I literally turned to my husband and asked, ""Why didn't we buy these sooner?!""1) They smell incredible-- just like pumpkin pie. The entire living room smells lovely as a result. A welcome change from some treats that smell horrible, if you know what I mean.2) I have two chihuahua puppies who NEVER sit still and who are NEVER quiet. Since giving them each a treat, I have enjoyed a full hour of total silence. They initially went NUTS over the treats, running all over the house waving them around-- then settled in and started chewing. They haven't stopped since. It's worth the asking price just to see them so content!3) The puppies obviously love the flavor. I'm buying more immediately. Hopefully this will keep them from chewing on furniture for a while...","One person found this helpful","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Puppy-Teething-Pumpkin-Flavor%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00X6THK2S%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhBFVCSVoZTmZMpoVPYktRgtVlmzvq9U3Hjv%252FO%252B0snm3CAAAAAGXT4VUAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRPEKPI1449TJO&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hBFVCSVoZTmZMpoVPYktRgtVlmzvq9U3Hjv%2FO%2B0snm3CAAAAAGXT4VUAAAAB&reviewId=RPEKPI1449TJO","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"
