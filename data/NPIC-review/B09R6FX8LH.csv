They are expensive so it’s their Sunday treat.","","","","","","","2 people found this helpful","","Report","","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Teething-Sticks-Chicken-7-28-oz%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09R6FX8LH%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhEd%252BN2YI6XpdV%252BI2%252FIcnd67bH9UJHUJ1K%252F9rSMlu9M69AAAAAGXT3%252BcAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2WLQO6QX43R51&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Showing  comments","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hEd%2BN2YI6XpdV%2BI2%2FIcnd67bH9UJHUJ1K%2F9rSMlu9M69AAAAAGXT3%2BcAAAAB&reviewId=R2WLQO6QX43R51","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif",""

He had his first of these chews at 8 weeks old and it lasted about 20-25 minutes. He is now 16 weeks old and it only takes him 10ish minutes to go through one. It would be great at this price point if they lasted a bit longer, but he loves them and I love that they aren't as smelly as a lot of other chews we have tried. Overall I would recommend and will likely buy another pack.","","","","","","","5 people found this helpful","","Report","","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Teething-Sticks-Chicken-7-28-oz%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09R6FX8LH%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhPKe29iqalbZ0cZpLetx2zRtkqigqjDx%252BUJAAbQ1%252BEBTAAAAAGXT3%252FAAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRRY6EAQL5MP05&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Showing  comments","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPKe29iqalbZ0cZpLetx2zRtkqigqjDx%2BUJAAbQ1%2BEBTAAAAAGXT3%2FAAAAAB&reviewId=RRY6EAQL5MP05","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif",""
