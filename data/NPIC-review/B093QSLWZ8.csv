He’s a Lab who loves all food, but even with that, he really liked these rings. At first he enjoyed playing with the ring and then figured out that he could eat it. I thought he’d finish the ring in a few minutes, but it actually took about 20+ minutes for him to finish the ring. Considering how quickly he eats treats, 20+ minutes is a long time so I’ll be definitely buying more of these teething rings.As far as ingredients,  “natural salmon flavor” and salmon are the 6th and 7th ingredient, so, it’s not surprising that I didn’t notice any fishy odor with these teething rings.I received these rings in September 2021 and they have an expiration date of October 25, 2022.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Teething-Salmon-Natural-912566%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB093QSLWZ8%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhOJiDazAWaKooRMJtnMUCTU5B6caZWtu4%252B9bWbH6K14%252FAAAAAGXT8fgAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRFQ0U989RF7RA&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOJiDazAWaKooRMJtnMUCTU5B6caZWtu4%2B9bWbH6K14%2FAAAAAGXT8fgAAAAB&reviewId=RFQ0U989RF7RA","Showing  comments","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"

He’s a Lab who loves all food, but even with that, he really liked these rings. At first he enjoyed playing with the ring and then figured out that he could eat it. I thought he’d finish the ring in a few minutes, but it actually took about 20+ minutes for him to finish the ring. Considering how quickly he eats treats, 20+ minutes is a long time so I’ll be definitely buying more of these teething rings.As far as ingredients,  “natural salmon flavor” and salmon are the 6th and 7th ingredient, so, it’s not surprising that I didn’t notice any fishy odor with these teething rings.I received these rings in September 2021 and they have an expiration date of October 25, 2022.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Teething-Salmon-Natural-912566%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB093QSLWZ8%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhAHEUelskT4Ma%252Bl3P5ULzr7k3ODhDG5Vkt1MtgYzMUeHAAAAAGXT8gAAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRFQ0U989RF7RA&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hAHEUelskT4Ma%2Bl3P5ULzr7k3ODhDG5Vkt1MtgYzMUeHAAAAAGXT8gAAAAAB&reviewId=RFQ0U989RF7RA","Showing  comments",""
