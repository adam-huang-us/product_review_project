B00JN9EP6E,Alanamous,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect cover-up for the poop eating pup!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2019","My pup is one of those dogs who has the nasty habit of eating poop. If I don't monitor her then she will eat her own and  her sister's feces as well. Plus, both of my pups love to eat the cat and possum poop that gets burried under the mulch along the sidewalks late at night while the rest of the neighborhood sleeps soundly and unsuspectingly. My pups will yank me off course the second they smell the pungent poop de possum, burrying their noses in the dirt and slurping it up before I am able to react. DISGUSTING!!!!Lucky for me, awhile ago a friend accidentally had one of her orders from Chewy shipped to me. We got everything straightened out and sent her a new box, but I got to keep the box sent to me and I shared some of the goodies with a local rescue too. Anyways, among the goodies she had ordered were these Twistix Yogurt Chew Treats. She had ordered both the banana and mint flavors. I gave one to each of my sweet puppies, at a time when they were behaving, and I noticed how wonderful it made their breath smell. Surprisingly enough, my doggy doo doo eater normally has pretty good breath, however my other pup has pretty disgusting breath from licking her anal glands. Poop pup.Well, the next time Poopy Puppy managed to snag herself a disgusting snack I decided she needed to floss her teeth with a Twistix Yogurt and Banana Dental Chew treat. Boy am I glad I gave her one! It did the trick of cleaning out the nasty particles that I could see clinging to her back teeth when she had flashed me a big, toothy grin and I easily caught a waft of her sewage breath. But after the Twistix I wasn't as paranoid about her stealing one of my pillows off of the couch or doing something equally appalling.I know I chose to live with this disgusting monster, and I definitely love her. But I'm truly thankful to have discovered something that helps make the difficult parts much more bearable. Because it's no fun to think the best thing in your life is unbearable in the slightest."
B00JN9EP6E,Lynn Y.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dog Loves These,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2024",My dog thinks this is a treat and she is very fussy.
B00JN9EP6E,Lola's Mommy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product but WAY overpriced for some reason,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2018","I took a star off because for some reason the price recently jumped from $4 to $12. Last time this happened was because of repackaging so fingers crossed it goes back down again soon. That said, my dog absolutely loves these and has been eating one of these a day since she was a puppy. She has a severe underbite and her bottom teeth stick out no matter what, but our vet is always shocked those teeth are in perfect condition. As a puppy they told us we might have to remove those teeth in a year or two because they’re constantly out and would rot, but we’re almost to 9 years & the vet said to keep doing what we’re doing because those teeth are in great condition!"
B00JN9EP6E,Karen Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,No more poop breath!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2023","My pup's breath smelled like poop, as if he ate some. I tried brushing and Dentastix but neither helped. After ne pack of these, his breath doesn't smell like poop anymore! I give him one after every meal, since certain foods will cause his breath to be extra stinky. Will definitely be buying more in the future."

B00JN9EP6E,Kp,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was worried about these treats when I first took them out of the bag because they're hard like chalk and my dog is 13 years ol,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2016","My Yorkie loves these treats. I was worried about these treats when I first took them out of the bag because they're hard like chalk and my dog is 13 years old. She didn't like them right away but after she started to spend some time on them, they started to dissolve and she could chew on them more easily. These treats are great for distracting dogs but you also have to be careful if they're a smaller dog because the treat is really hard and I could see it could cause choking in over ambitious dogs that don't take the time to break down the treat. The only flaw in these treats is that my dog has a beard and these treats get really milky and foamy and once she finishes her treat it looks like she has rabies and that she's foaming at the mouth. I always find chunks of unfinished twistix dental chews melted to her beard with foam. She loves them so much and they're good for her teeth so I can't complain. I just have to clean her up every time after she's had one of these treats."
B00JN9EP6E,DB's Treasures on Mercari,4.0 out of 5 stars,Dogs liked these dental stick!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2021","My 3 dogs enjoyed these dental sticks, even my picky dog, but I'll probably not buy them again because with having 3 dogs I need bulk... So if they ever offer a bulk of 100+ dental sticks at a decent discounted price per piece then I'm on board!"
B00JN9EP6E,Samantha dolan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Dog breath saver,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021",My 20 pound dog loves these. I give her one early in the day and one later in the day after dinner and they really seem to be helping with her bad breath. They are the first ones we’ve gotten that actually smell minty.
B00JN9EP6E,R. A. Hentz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dogs love ‘em & Mom feels good serving them!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020","This is probably my 75th bag of this product!  While I haven’t personally tasted them, my doggos go nutso for these. They love all of the Twistix flavors, but I think this is their fave (or it would be mine if I could eat them!).  As their fur-mommy, I love these bc they’re Made in the USA, with high-quality ingredients!  They are a little higher in calories, but my boys are small, so I buy the large size stix & cut them into thirds!!  Less calories and I get more out of the bag!!  Great purchase!"
B00JN9EP6E,NNS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Girls love them!!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","My girls LOVE these! Bonus, their breath smells great after I give them one. I wish there was a smaller size, I have to cut a half inch or so off the ones I give to buy 5lb dog. They take a long time to chew through, but my 6lb dog gets done with hers, before the 5lb one gets done with the one I made shorter.She then runs to get the other one, and of course the little one doesn't want that so she tries to eat it as quick as possible. That's why I make it smaller. I don't want her to choke."
B00JN9EP6E,Suz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best product we've tried so far,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2017","They actually help reduce dog breath! Best product we've tried so far. Surprisingly enough (with mint and vanilla flavor) they are my dog's favorite too - he'll do anything for them. The only drawback - the treats are large (even for my large dog - pictured) and seem pretty rich. I'd typically break them and feed half per day but they are more than difficult to break. Since they're so big, and with so few in the bag, i feed every other day."
B00JN9EP6E,Sharon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My dog's MOST favorite chew treat!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2018","My dog's MOST favorite chew treat. He is a 10 lb Jack Russell mix with Chihuhua. He is a very picky eater and I cook his food, all special made for him. He loves the taste of these and although it doesn't last but 10-15 min, he feels very rewarded with this very special "" treat toy"". We call them twisty toys, and he knows the word very well. I throw it up in air, and he catches it. Then he precedes with a throwing and catching game by himself, throwing in air and catching it, then chewing it. Great price too!"
B00JN9EP6E,**SPOILER ALERT**,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my dog's favorites,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2020","My dog loves these. This and the milk & cheese flavor are her favorites... the banana & yogurt, not so much. I have a min pin and even though I get the small I try not to give her an entire one. Usually, when I first open the bag, they are soft enough to cut through a little and break in half."
B00JN9EP6E,Kathryne A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,My dog cannot get enough!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2016","My dog ( american cocker spaniel) loves these things! Brushing his teeth can get tiresome, so these treats truly helps. I always oberseved him when I give him this treat because I am concerned about him choking on it. He usually takes the treat, runs, and eats it at his little hiding place. He places it between his paws, and just chews at it. I never heard him choke or cough it up, so I can say it looks pretty safe for him to eat and enjoy!He usually eats one stick under 2 minutes, and then goes looking for some more!"
B00JN9EP6E,Tana,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy Izzy-happy dog,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2019",Well its my dog eating this not me so I d not know on flavor and things but I watch as she smell items I give her this is one that gets an okay and off she goes treat in her mouth.

B00JN9EP6E,Lisa D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,low odor dental treats,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2020","my labradane loves these treats.  My kids will make a fuss when asked to give dental treats to the pupper if it isn't a twistix brand. these have a very subtle smell to them, which is nothing, compared to the odor emitted by some of the other dental treats. I'm in search of an economy pack now."
B00JN9EP6E,Hayley Barnett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a quick treat,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2021","My dog loved these but they last about two seconds!

B00JN9EP6E,Summer,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 corgis,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2020","I don't buy these very often, usually for holidays or what not.

B00JN9EP6E,Hannah L. Butcher,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice for a bit of change,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2017","My fur baby doesn't mind these, but prefers the greenies that she is used to. I think they are ok to give her a bit of variety from time to time, and fairly inexpensive. Can't really say how well they clean teeth compared. because she has always used greenies & her vet says her teeth look good."
B00JN9EP6E,Penny Olivia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My dog goes crazy for her twistix, she gets ...","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2016","My dog goes crazy for her twistix, she gets one every night before bedtime and as soon as it's dark she is jumping up and down next to the closet where we keep them waiting for it! I was a little scared of them at the beginning because they are hard, but her teeth are strong so she can handle them and totally enjoys them. I can't get them anywhere where I live so I truly hope Amazon never runs out or stops selling them."
B00JN9EP6E,M. Downey,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Dog Loves These and I Like The Scent Too,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2017","Even though my dog weighs 50 pounds and is a big chewer, I chose to get the smaller Twistix.  She gets one every night at bed time.  I hold onto it while she gnaws off the first 3 bites of it, then I give the last piece from my hand.  She loves them and I like that she's going to sleep for the night with cleaner teeth after eating the chew."

They are easy for them to chew up and they do not upset their stomachs.  The chews help to keep their teeth clean and their breath smells better.  These shorter size chews are nice for a more frequent snack, but they also come in a longer size which I like as well."

This means she enjoys chewing A LOT!!! She will get 3 chew sticks at least out of me a night...LoL I can barely keep up! She HATES these though, she licked it a little, but never decided to chew it up. They are hard as a rock, I don't see an ""expiration date"" on the package.??? The smell good and minty but, she has no interest. Do NOT waste your money on these! I see there is a chemical in them too, this angers me!! I think I should get a refund!! I WANT A REFUND!!!! This store is a rip off!!!!"

She chewed it for maybe 2 minutes and it was gone I was watching the whole time and it wasn't by any means softened or bit off in small pieces, the whole half was swallowed whole.  I'm even afraid of giving her the whole one now, that too might be swallowed."
B0CDRFBRNY,Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,So worth it,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024","My dog is a nervous wreck. She gets herself so worked up that she's just beside herself. These have been great for her as a distraction when she's getting to that point. It's not just the ingredients that make this calming. Gnawing on one of these lets her get some of her nervous energy out in a safe way, and I think it's been very effective. She struggles with separation anxiety and falls apart when I leave, but if I give her one of these first and then sneak out the door she does a lot better. I'd definitely recommend these for any anxious dogs out there!"
B0CDRFBRNY,Tara Lang,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good treats,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023","My dogs loved these just as much as the popular brand of dog dental treats. They are much more firm by my feel, but they chewed them up fine. I have an Australian shepherd and a beagle. I was worried about the beagle swallowing it whole, but she chewed it well.I did not notice a difference in their energy levels- my Aussie is very energetic and my 13 year old Beagle has high anxiety. Maybe with more use I would notice a change.I'm not a fan of the smell, but it's not terrible. Just weird. Like perfumed beef jerky."
B0CDRFBRNY,Wesley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthy and my dogs love them,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","These are great chews. The ingredients are natural and healthy, and my dogs really love them.Potatoes are the first ingredient, and there are a number of calming ingredients like chamomile, hops, passion flower, lemon balm, and lavender.They really do seem to calm my dogs down after around 20 minutes of chewing.  But I wish they told you the amount of active ingredients; you have no way of knowing the dosage of herbs in a product like this without that information.Still, the quality is very good and my dogs like them so I'm satisfied.Overall - good quality calming chews for dogs, but probably not the most effective calming treats out there."
B0CDRFBRNY,Kimberly Trujillo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Travel aid,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2023","We take our animals on vacation with us and we do all we can to make sure that they are safe and comfortable when we rent a house we will turn a room into an animal calm safe space to put them when we need to go out we know they are in a new environment and weirded out to be left alone so we want to make them as comfortable as possible. We bring their blankets white noise machines, all of their toys and their special treats that they only get on special occasions or traveling when we laughed and gave one of these to the dogs we let her start eating it before we left the house completely and she still had her eyes on us she looked like she was just really into the flavor. We laughed and went outside to peek through the window, just to see how it was since we finally left, she just seemed to calmly enjoy her treat , when we got home, she and the cat were both napping together it didn’t look like the cat had jumped around and disturbed too much or that the dog had really done anything either. It was very nice to come in to that pleasant relaxing site of them instead of seeing signs of distress and them scratching and whining at the door as soon as they heard us coming in"
B0CDRFBRNY,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not very calming,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023","I didn't notice a difference in behavior. As a dental chew, it only lasted maybe 30 seconds, but I have a very aggressive chewer. Overall, these didn't work as expected, but my dog still enjoyed them."
B0CDRFBRNY,D.p.B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Chewies that my dogs enjoy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2023","My dogs really like these dark colored chew sticks and will keep them busy for about 5 minutes.  These are supposedly chicken flavor and upon opening the bag, you get the scent of chicken bouillon and original Pringles potato chips.  I would surmise that they are definitely flavored like chicken and that my dogs seem to really like them.  The dark color of the sick does not seem to stain light carpet, but if you have a dog that likes to lick and moisten the treat before eating it then that may be a different story, however neither their teeth nor tongue were stained after eating these treats.  I can't say how well they clean teeth or freshen breath, but since the sticks are pleasantly scented, they don't seem to contribute to foul smelling breath.  These sticks are about the right size for small and medium sized dogs, however any size dog would probably like these treats.  If you are looking for a chew treat for your dog that actually has chicken scent, these are it."
B0CDRFBRNY,Jamie Arehart,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","I would not recommend for senior dogs due to teeth and chewing. These dental sticks are pretty hard to bite into and not that easy to break up.Once I got one cut up for him and he ate it, he seemed to be calmer throughout the day and he did not seem to mind the taste.I do not recommend these for dogs with any kind of dental issues. These are a hard chew."

B0CDRFBRNY,Jennifer Lombardo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Half a Stick for Three Pound Puppy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023",Our new toy poodle thought he had stolen a treat when we dropped it on the floor for him.  He quickly took it back to his bed and chewed all day.  We only gave him half a stick since he is three pounds.  I am thankful for a product like this as it is a nightmare to try and brush his teeth.  I took off one star since he wasn't totally in love with the flavor like some bones I had given him.
B0CDRFBRNY,Jamie,4.0 out of 5 stars,My dog loves them!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2023","I have a heeler mix who has some anxiety issues. She loves these treats!

B0CDRFBRNY,KP,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice for puppies that chew,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023","These treats are really nice for puppies that love to chew! They have a very firm texture that makes them somewhat challenging to chew up.My son's puppy loves these! I can't say they have any ""calming"" capabilities though.They are good treats despite not having a calming effect."
B0CDRFBRNY,Julie A. Parent,4.0 out of 5 stars,Gone so fast!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","I gave these treats to my dog, and he absolutely loved them.

B0CDRFBRNY,Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dogs Love Them!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2023","I didn't think these smelled very good, but my dogs disagree wholeheartedly.  They came running when I opened the bag, and all five wanted their sample.  Even my old girl who's been under the weather wanted to eat these.  I did have to break it up into little bites for her, but the other dogs had no problem chewing and eating them.  As far as having calming properties, I didn't really see much evidence of that, but my dogs don't tend to be really high strung anyway.  My old lady has anxiety and she does seem a little calmer, but she's also under the weather.  I'm just glad she wanted to eat something!"
B0CDRFBRNY,TheBeesKnees,5.0 out of 5 stars,dogs love,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023","More firm/solid/hard than other dental sticks I've given the dogs. That is encouraging since it requires more chewing and a better chance of it knocking plaque off.The dogs liked these and ate theirs in a couple of minutes. I gave it near the end of the day. Neither dog was super active nor had the zoomies before hand, but now both are laying on the couch relaxing, one is even snoring. I'd say they are relaxed.I'm not sure this would calm a dog that is already hyped up, but in the same way a cup of tea won't help an angry human, but it can make nighttime even more relaxing, I look forward to helping the boys wind down for the night with a calming treat."

B0CDRFBRNY,Angie Bailey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nic,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2023","These treats don’t smell like your typical dog treats. They are decent sized treats. I gave them to my two Pitbulls and my stepdaughter’s Aussiedoodle and they were able to eat these treats easily within just a couple of minutes. They seemed to really enjoy them. However, these treats are a bit too big and hard for my Pomeranian to eat. I can’t say they calmed the down much though."

She has started getting tired of many of the treats I usually get her. When I opened this package she came running. She has been eating these for several nights and is still in love with them. She's 60lbs and these are a good size for her,  so if you have smaller dogs you might want to break these into smaller pieces."

However, I gave them a shot with my pets and I was 1/2 in terms of them liking it. One would not touch it at all and the other was fine chewing on it and ate it pretty fast.Again, idk if the super dark color is normal, but I'm watching closely my pets after they eat this. In terms of ""Calming"" them idk if it has much impact to be hones, but I only started with a half stick. I can't give this a great review, nor is it a bad one so leaving this as 3 stars."

Most of our program has trained with hot dogs, however carrying a pocket of hotdogs around isn't always feasible.

But as soon as I opened the bag, he was engaged. These are a soft chew and don't give off a lot of mess on your hands or your pocket and they're small enough that they are a good reward without taking too long for them to chomp down before the next repetition.I think for the price and the quality these are a great treat to keep your little ones focused on the task at hand an learning."

My puppy would chew on this for a few minutes or at night but this could not keep his attention for very long. Maybe he didn't care for the flavor as much as he liked my shoes but who knows. This is why I am giving it a 4/5 because other bones and such I have purchased have kept his attention for hours. My puppy did use this just not for very long. It's a product you need to try for your puppy if you think it will help with their teething. Not expensive at all, in fact seen this at my local pet store for $5 more."

Bottom of the bag just has treats that have become powdered. Not sure if this is how the product is supposed to be or not or if this is just old treats. The best by date is September 23 but it doesn’t say when it was manufactured. I feel like I’m being sent old almost expired products so they can clear inventory. I would think companies would want to send out the best product so that customers will keep coming to buy. This kind of product being sent creates a 1 time purchase and never again. I’m additionally both cats just looked at it and walked away. Mind you these cats when they see a treat they never say no. So disappointed. I wish I was sent new fresh product. Disappointed

Woody,4.0 out of 5 stars,one out of three cats will eat these but that is the one who I needed to and these have helped him,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2021","So the 2 year old healthy cat won't touch these, the five year old fat cat ate these once then wouldn't eat them again.  The 4 month old stray we adopted over a month ago who is having a hard time kicking a pretty bad kitty herpes flare loves these and he is the one who I needed these for.  We have been giving him 500mg lysine twice a day as the vet directed and keeping him on antibiotics to prevent a bacterial side infection in his lungs, but he has not been getting any better.  Within two days of giving him these he has less rattling in his lungs, this has been the only improvement in his condition we have seen in over a month.  I did the math and for 6 chews there is only about 70mg of lysine, and since we have been giving him high doses of lysine for over a month the lysine is obviously not the ingredient in these chews that is helping.  I am therefore left to assume it is the probiotic.  While he is still far from recovered this has given me hope and I am going to look into a more broad spectrum probiotic and see if we can get him over this flare and onto a preventive regime which I think these chews will make be a part of."
B09FQ9VZNP,ChiefB & SweetieBoo,3.0 out of 5 stars,My Cat Thumbs His Nose At This,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2021","Every cat is an individual, and they know what they like and what they don't. Although many cats seem to love these Biteables, my senior cat would have nothing to do with it. I tried a single treat whole, then broken in half, and he just sniffed it and walked away each time. The next morning I even broke one in half and hid it in the middle of his wet cat food, which he normally inhales the minute I put it in his bowl. He ate around the treat halves and left them in his otherwise empty bowl. He loves chicken, which is the primary ingredient in these treats, but apparently that wasn't enough to entice him. In people years my cat is 88 years old, so it's not like he's going to change his food preferences at this stage of his life. The ""chicken and tuna recipe"" on the package is a bit misleading, since the tuna is only ""natural tuna flavor"" and not the real deal, and the same with the ""natural fish flavor."" I am still rating this product 3 stars even though my cat didn't like it because I think the L-lysine, taurine, and probiotics probably would have been good for him if he had been willing to eat these treats."
B09FQ9VZNP,Cathy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Soft treats for your cst,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021",So I was really hoping our cats would love these soft treats so I could feel good about giving treats that had some health value to them. Unfortunately only 1 of our 3 cats would remotely touch them and it was only once.  I’m sure it’s just that our cats are picky about their food and treats.  They seems to be good quality with good packaging. Our cats just prefer the junky treats to the healthy ones. Go figure.
B09FQ9VZNP,Joe Smart,2.0 out of 5 stars,Both of my cats hate the flavor,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2021","Different cats have different tastes so normally I wouldn't give a product two stars just because my cats didn't like the flavor but I really think it's warranted and possibly even generous in the case of Get Naked Essential Health Biteables because both of my cats really love treats but they absolutely hate these.The package boasts that Get Naked Biteables provide essential health benefits including lysine and probiotics and that the #1 ingredient is real chicken--although that last one doesn't actually mean anything because they could be saying that the highest quality or most expensive ingredient is chicken, not necessarily that chicken makes up the largest actual portion.  In any case, these are not cat food--they are cat treats.  With cat food, strong health benefits are definitely something you want to look for but with treats the number one most important thing is flavor.  Cats should be thrilled when you pull out the package and they see that you are about to give them a treat.I have two cats.  They both love treats.  They both ate exactly one of these Get Naked Bitables treats and will not touch them again.  They absolutely hate the flavor which means these aren't much of a treat as far as my cats are concerned.  Get Naked Biteables might well be very nutritious but they neglected the single most important thing that every cat treat needs which is great taste."
B09FQ9VZNP,GK5040,4.0 out of 5 stars,A treat that is more like a vitamin!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2021","Our Siamese kitten is kind of picky about her food yet she loved these soft heart shaped chewable cat treats. They are made in the USA, and chicken is the first ingredient, however they smell more fishlike.  These treats are more than a treat, they are a probiotic containing Lysine which is an essential amino acid helps pets produce antibodies and enzymes that support immune systems.  It is also helpful for calcium absorption which supports strong bones and promotes healthy skin. This is important, so our kitties can fight diseases and have healthy bones. Cats do not make lysine on their own. They must obtain it through their food and supplements.  L-lysine is not for all cats so check with your vet. I do not agree on the dosage. I think these treats should be used sparingly because it can interfere with other medications. The package is small but affordable. I’m feeding our 7 month old cat one a day to support a healthy gut and immune system."
B09FQ9VZNP,Dzilizi,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cats like them,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2021","My cats really like these.  As in gobbled them down before the dog realized they were getting treats.  I may have to replace the other lysine treats with these.  However, a serving size is something like 4 or 5 a day.  With the number of cats I have, they will go fast. The other lysine treats I use are one to two a day.  And they aren't as popular.  Though fortunately, the one cat that really needs them also likes them.  And price-wise, they are about the same.However, they do make a joint health treat that I may have to try for my cat with a damaged spine (before I owned him - got him that way from the vet where he was dropped off)  I've yet to find a treat/pill that he will take."

B09FQ9VZNP,Jeannette Belliveau,5.0 out of 5 stars,Combination of treat and treatment for my feline,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2021","My older gray tabby has had feline herpesvirus since she was a young adult. Lysine can be a good thing to try to help these cats with their symptoms of sneezing and rasping. She loves these Biteables and seems to think they are a treat on par with Temptations, and that is in contrast to other lysine supplements she has quickly lost interest in.Cats with breathing difficulties sometimes also have trouble with their sense of smell, and I suspect the ingredients here such as natural fish and tuna flavors are strong enough (but pleasant to the human nose) to maintain their appeal to a congested kitty. The main ingredients here are chicken, glycerin, sweet potatoes, tapioca starch and L-lysine.These snacks also contains dried Bacillus fermentation product, designed to promulgate digestive health.The manufacturer recommends five to six of these soft treats per day. The treats are made in the US and specifics are not provided (that I can see) on where the ingredients are sourced.Review of Get Naked Essential Health Biteables, Land & Sea Recipe, 3 oz,Natural,912672"

However, the Biteables are more than treats. They're a source of good nutrition too! They weren't universally accepted in my household as 3 out of 4 of my cats gobbled the treats down while one refused them. So this may not be for every cat. But given that they're a better alternative to traditional treats, I think they're worth a try. They have a soft texture and seem fresh right out of the resealable package.Made in the USA~ Kort"
B09FQ9VZNP,Brenda Marie,5.0 out of 5 stars,<3 My kitty LOVES these <3,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2021","My kitty LOVES these treats – like climbing on me to get them!  So, no problem there at all.  My kitty is a big long kitty weighing in at 16 pounds, though.  The directions say to give 5 to 6 treats for cats over 5 pounds.  I am not a scientist but maybe my kitty would rather need like 10 to 15 treats for her weight?  I dunno – I know sometimes it doesn’t work that way.  Either way – 5 to 6 treats every day seems like a lot for my baby.  I don’t give her many treats – and definitely not even every day.  So, for me – these work more of a treat with benefits rather than a supplement.  But to each their own.  Taste wise – my baby LOVES these – and that is what is most important!If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )"

They're semi-moist, not at all crunchy, which my cats seem to prefer. They hold their shape, but you can push a fingernail in them. I got them for one elderly cat who's stool seemed to be a bit looser then normal on occasion and the vet could find no reason. I thought the probiotic aspect couldn't hurt and might help. I've been giving him the 5 per day as recommended but see no change other than the other cats resent me for not giving them as many, lol. It's only been about a week and a half and I'm running out so I'm not sure if my cat's issue is not probiotic related (probably) or I haven't been giving him these long enough or if that aspect of these is no good.But they all like them as treats so I'm happy."

This is the longest lasting so far.I get her the largest possible size. She’ll go through a small Nylabone in about 10 mins. This takes her a few hours but more importantly it keeps her attention and satisfies her chewing urge.My frenchie is about 15 pounds at six months old and has most of her adult teeth, they’re still growing in and she needs to sink them into something.Tbh I hesitated about getting such a big bone for my small dog, but it was the right call. Not only does it keep her busy for a while but because it’s so big, it’s stripped her of the urge she started getting with the small bones to swallow them whole as soon as they seems small enough. Now she chews it down to a tiny nub and doesn’t try to swallow it (tho I still grab it and throw it away if I see it).Good bone, do recommend for smaller dog if they are a strong chewer."

B007RW7CJQ,Michelle,3.0 out of 5 stars,Caution; Throw Out When It Gets Hard!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2021","So, I've been getting these for my dog a while now. She normally scarfs them down over the course of an hour, but the latest time, she decided she wanted to keep one end of it to put in her little treat stash. About a week later, she grabbed it, we played fetch with it (it was hard like rock now) and she ate it; I thought nothing of it because it still chewed apart. Later that day, about 12 hours, she threw up a large amount pieces that weren't digesting. Even though they weren't splintering, the pieces were just sitting in her stomach like a bunch of rocks. They were getting smoother and I'm sure still digesting, but they were also causing obvious pain to her and she was unable to eat anything else while they were still clanking around in her stomach.I'd still absolutely recommend these to dog owners, but with much more caution and awareness. Once the texture isn't the soft-ish bendable feel it was out of the bag, its time to toss it. I got lucky she threw them up, and that none of the harder bits did splinter, but its important to be aware of things like intestinal blockages or damage that can occur from treats that appear fine."

B007RW7CJQ,Chelsie Lay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing ever! So glad I found these!!!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2019",These are absolutely the new chew bones in our home from now on!!! I have 7 dogs and do rescue so we have a houseful and most are large dogs and can chew almost any bobe in like 2 seconds....but not these. Also they keep interest in them I guess due to the peanut butter flavor. The price is great as well. I was buying smartbones which they love but ate in literally 2 minutes and whimsies which lasted about 5. These last several hours with the biggest power chewer i have which is a 157lb Neapolitan Mastiff. So glad I found these bones!! And my Mastiff has had 2 yes 2 surgeries to remove foreign objects which one was a handtowel but the other was rawhide so these are rawhide free and so much safer. I will be buying these from here on out!! And telling everyone about them as i am a vet tech!!!

B007RW7CJQ,Maryland Oracle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They love the peanut butter flavor, but it never lasts too long!","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2021","We have a couple of active chewers to keep happy.  So, once a week, they get a P Nutter each.  A good, edible chew bone in the evening gets them relaxed.  Pork skin is fine...like pretzels to you and me, but they love peanut butter.  So, we trade off a longer-lasting, tougher chew bone for the taste they love.  If we get 10 minutes of quiet off these bones, everyone is pleased."

This bone has lasted 1 hour and is still almost a complete bone. It is a little messy but it is worth it to help the teething and it keeps the puppies occupied"
B007RW7CJQ,taylor m.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best dog bone ever!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2017","My pup (almost 7 month old) loves these! I first found this product at TJ Maxx in the pet area and bought a bunch when I adopted her cause I knew she would be a chewer! (Labradoodle) unfortunately for me they haven't had them again and I was so bummed when I couldn't find them in any near by stores! Thank god they have them here on because I tried to give her those wood scented/flavored chew sticks and she wouldn't touch it after a few days!Decided to go with a monthly subscription because of how much she loves them. Better to have to many that's none at all!!The best part is how long they last!!! She carries them with her wherever she goes; around the house, to the car, to visit relatives. Great product and I hope they add the chicken flavored ones on here for subscription too!"
B007RW7CJQ,S. Baker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sturdy and tasty,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2020","I got these for a potentially long car trip but ended up finding a sitter for my pup, so I saved them for when I could supervise her and see just how durable and safe these were. Well, turns out they’re pretty durable as we are at least 20 min into a mad chew session and there are only a few scratches to show for it! She loves it, it seems. I’m sure once she makes progress I’ll have to toss some as it will turn into a choking hazard but that is going to take a while. Good buy."

B007RW7CJQ,Scott,2.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted 1 hour & upset stomach,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2023","Wouldn’t recommend. We like N-Bones products, the teething rings have been amazing for our puppy but I got this and our 12lb dog finished the whole thing in maybe an hour. When I took it out of the packaging it was already like melting/crumbing off on my hands. Also caused some gastrointestinal distress, but that’s not surprising considering it is pretty big and she ate the whole thing in one sitting lol."
B007RW7CJQ,Laura,5.0 out of 5 stars,Chewers Chew,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020",N-bone is a great actually long lasting chew that keeps my great pyr entertained for quite a while. It is one of the few she hasn't been able to eat in a matter of minutes and keeps her from chewing on things that are a big no no. Definitely recommend this chew if your dog is a hardy chewer. Im not afraid to leave it with her while I'm out for a couple of hours and I feel that it won't break a tooth so I'd say its almost the perfect chew.
B007RW7CJQ,Ruff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally - something that lasts!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020","So our pup can blast through just about anything you toss his way - I don't care what ""chew level"" it is. He is definitely a super chewer. He is absolutely relentless. He's had this bone in his possession for a few weeks now, and it's still going strong! He loves to gnaw on it. Now it does get a little rough on the ends - when it does, just take a little sandpaper or an emory board to it and it will smooth right back down. Very happy with this purchase!"

I bought one of these to try out instead of our usual bully sticks. She was immediately jazzed by the smell, and she wouldn't put it down for a long while. She's able to scrape small lines into it, and hasn't gotten any chunks so far. It's going to last a while, and I'm happy that it keeps her occupied. The price is great for how much occupation it gives her!"

After reading reviews I thought for sure these would last much longer. Overall it’s a nice treat to have handy but definitely not affordable for multiple-times-a-week-use for big dogs. I’ll be going back to the bulk bagged rawhide alternatives, which seem to last at least a couple of days. For reference my dogs are 80 lbs and 115 lbs."

She isn't a great huge hulking dog either...she is a corgi mix and can still put these bones away sometimes faster than real bones. Real bones are kinda rough on her innards, but these bones seem to break down in her digestion system much better. So they are a winner with me."

B007RW7CJQ,dinah jolie,2.0 out of 5 stars,Three Unimpressed Furbabies,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021","I was so optimistic about this purchase. Admittedly, it’s hard to find a chew bone that all three of my dogs unanimously agree on. However this time they did agree and the verdict is that they were unimpressed by the flavor of this bone.The size is great. The texture holds up pretty nicely to aggressive chewing. While it doesn’t stain fabric, it does leave a faint residue when wet from slobber. There’s absolutely no smell which is wonderful. The only downside is that my dogs weren’t impressed with the flavor. With that said, I’m hopeful that there are less finicky pups out there who might actually enjoy the product!"

B0175BN7B0,sara,3.0 out of 5 stars,Prongs can easily snap off causing choking hazard,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2022",Ours fell apart and my dog started to choke on it-it’s like a giant jacks and it can easily be taken apart. I have a Lhasa and a Shih Tzu who are 20lbs/11lbs and not big chewers. My Lhasa barely touched his and one of the prongs came off and we couldn’t get it out of his mouth when he started to choke on the knub he had reduced the broken prong to. Thankfully my teen son was home and between the two of us we got it out of his throat. Really scary stuff. They’re not hard like a yak stick-more of a softer medium and the prongs can easily be snapped. Something to think about if you plan to leave your dog unsupervised or they’re hard to get a treat back from.

I’m not sure the bone lasted ten minutes. Based on the packaging and general design of the toy, it seemed like it was designed to last. In reality you are better off buying a box of treats for the same price. I have a 3 year old Pitt mix who is an aggressive chewer.

We've tried probably a dozen different dental chews in the past (in all price ranges), but we found a favorite in Get Naked.  We love all the recognizable ingredients, plus the vitamins and antioxidants added to these dental chews.  And they've never upset my one dog's highly sensitive tummy (which is rare).  And for two 5lb dogs chewing on these 5 minutes a day, the price is right.  Overall, my dogs love these more than their actual treats, and ""cleaning"" their teeth tartar is definitely the favorite part of their day."

They seem to satisfy her insatiable chewing problem (at least for a few minutes), and her teeth are sparkly white with very little tartar build up. I like that they have GOOD things inside, not random yucky bits like so many dog treats. We've gone through ten packs of these in various flavors and will continue to buy them for her as long as she continues to love them (we rotate flavors so she doesn't get bored). She seems to like the pink ones the most, but never turns away the other flavors (and she does turn away other brands of dental chews!).

These used to be soft, waxy, fatty treats. Now there mostly dust and crumble with the slightest pressure. One of my ferrets won't eat them and shows no interest (but usually loves these) and I don't really feel comfortable feeding them to either because they look expired or poorly formulated. I don't know what happened. These are available with the usual consistency through Petco. Additionally, Amazon/seller won't accept return or replacement of this item in particular. (Though it says we still have about a month left for returns per Amazons policy, this seller doesn't allow returns/refunds.)"

B014KLSBDW,FGC,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bacon Flavor in Chicken Packages,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2022","I have purchased these many times as my ferret loves their chicken flavor treats. Oddly though, the last time I purchased 2 bags of the chicken flavor ones they looked darker, almost black. My ferret would not eat them. I already purchased the bacon flavor for him awhile ago and he would not eat those either. In the provided picture, the first bag (left) are the chicken ones I am referring to that I just bought and he won't eat. The bag in the middle is my last ""good"" ones I bought and the last time they shipped the ones he loved. Note that these are way lighter in color than the ones on the left. The bag on the right are the bacon ones he won't eat. So, in conclusion, the chicken bag ones on the left look exactly like the bacon ones in the bag on the right. I think they may have put the bacon flavor ones in the chicken bags by mistake. Now I am afraid to order more as I can't be sure they will be correctly packaged and Amazon will not accept returns for them. If you know ferrets, they can be very fussy regarding food and treats so I hope someone that can do something to fix this problem will see this review!"

He's not food motivated at all and has been super accepting of his diet that includes free feeding good quality kibble with canned offered instead a few days a week. He definitely loves and wants that canned food but even then, never really eats with gusto. I say all this to explain that he just doesn't get all that excited over any food, but he does enjoy these treats.They are rather large, at least 5x the size of a single piece of kitten kibble, but no problem, because breaking these treats up is easy and makes treat time last a little longer.I also worried that these treats would arrive all smashed and broken as some reviewers have experienced, but that wasn't the case here. Lots of soft little hearts that I can break up myself.I feel good that I'm offering a healthy, low calorie treat, and that that my silly, wild, non-food-motivated little guy likes them enough to pause his crazy play time for one of these."

The only problem I had with these (and why I rated 4 stars) is that the treats are quite large for a kitten. I have to break them into two or three pieces to feed to her since her mouth is so little right now. They are super easy to break up into smaller pieces, so no issues there, I just wish the treats were a little smaller so I didn’t have to.For size comparison, I showed the treat next to her kitten food (Purina One Plus, healthy kitten formula)"

They absolutely adored these.They’re harder than I thought they’d be, so I wouldn’t recommend for teething kittens. My boys were about 4 months had to work to chew it. As they got older it was a lot easier, so take the age into consideration before ordering.One of them has a very sensitive tummy and this didn’t do much besides give him some terrible smelling poop.

They are a lot denser than most soft treats I've bought in the past, which also makes it harder to chew."

Even older cats. They're actually a bit large for a kitten I think, so I've broken them in half. Pretty sure everyone likes them and no troubles from eating them that I noticed.

B00X6THK2S,MLouise,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Buy this Over and Over,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2023","I have had this on my Subscribe and Save for quite awule now. My dogs are not puppies, so I don't use these for ""puppy teething"". I give them pieces of these purely for healthy bedtime treats. I use kitchen shears to cut the rings into several pieces (each piece about an inch long).Then at bedtime, when my doggies are done eating for the day, they each get one piece. I feel the chewing motion helps clean their teeth and release healthy enzymes in their mouths. I love that the ingredients in these are so healthy and natural.And best of all my pups love their nighttime routine. They go out to potty, then race up on the porch and through the door to get their nightly pumpkin treats. Then time to snuggle with mommy & daddy!Oh, one more thing....once in awhile I get a bag where the rings are extra hard and brittle. When that happens, I just wet a clean paper towel, ring it out, then put it in the bag with the treats. I leave it sealed that way for about 24 hours. After that, they are more pliable and my kitchen shears cut through much better. And they are less brittle for my dogs' teeth that way too."

So we’ve been loving them until they get to a certain point, and then I feel like I’m wasting money by throwing the rest away. Maybe a different shape would be better?"

B00X6THK2S,Tayler,4.0 out of 5 stars,A teething must!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020","I can't imagine ever going through a teething puppy again without getting these. My Aussie is obsessed with them. They're the perfect texture between chewy and hard to keep her entertained for a good 10 minutes.Our pup always puts her ears back and closes her eyes when her teeth hurt and she's chewing on something that helps it. These help! The fact that they're curved into rings seems to really help her target whichever side of her mouth is hurting.That being said, these rings are HUGE. There are only 6 in a pack because they're so big, and the serving size starts at 1/4 a day?! So what, am I supposed to take the ring away after she's chewed through part of it? I did that and my dog tried to swallow the piece whole and choked on it. I got around that by just cutting the rings into quarter pieces (which takes a little patience).My pup LOVES these, especially the pumpkin, so I foresee getting these for the next few months, even when she's done teething."

They don't smell like something I imagine a dog would like. But to my surprise she went for it and enjoyed. She didn't finish it in one sitting, but she's also only a mild chewer. I don't think these necessarily helped her breath to smell any better in the long run but it gave her something to chew on for a good amount of time and her breath smelled decent shortly after. I think the ring shape was also fun for her."

They helped me get through the teething phase so I would have a break from reprimanding him. They used to take him about 15-20min to get through 1/4 of a ring… Unfortunately he just got all of his adult teeth now he eats half of a ring in about 5 minutes so I’m looking for a more appropriate adult treat to keep him busy now. Ps they smell AMAZING and make your puppy’s breath smell like cinnamon after eating. My guy seems to like the chicken flavor the best but those smell good too

IT'S really important to be with your pup do NOT put these in a crate or give to them and leave. These do not last very long.  10-15 min at most.I gave him a treat and about 10 minutes in he started acting weird.... pawing at his face, doing weir stuff with his mouth.  I could tell something was wrong and I thought he was choking. Stuck my finger down his throat- didn't feel anything, felt his throat nothing was protruding.  He was distressed.  Was putting on my shoes and grabbing my purse to run to the vet when I grabbed a flashlight- turned him over pried his mouth open and the darn piece was stuck to the roof of his mouth.  (he loves these but, now I'm worried that they could do other damage if he swallows that big of a chunk)"
B00X6THK2S,Brittany,5.0 out of 5 stars,Basically crack for dogs,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2020","My dog loves these so much she knows the bag from all of her other treat bags. She loses her mind! She is now 4 months old with most of her adult teeth and can kill it in about 15 minutes, but when she was about 8 weeks old, she would work at it for 1-2 days. They smell great, like a pumpkin pie, and I haven't seen any indication of digestive issues. It makes me feel better knowing there are so many good ingredients and none (if very little) of the crap. I've bought 3 bags now, which is becoming expensive so I may try to make some pumpkin treats myself since she doesn't really need the hardness of these for teething anymore.At first I was worried about her choking when she gets a chunk broken off, but she chews pretty thoroughly before she swallows. Regardless, I always supervise while she's chewing."

I can’t say how they are for teething exactly because she eats it very quickly, but they are a special treat for her. One thing to note, though, is they seem to make her very thirsty, so she gets no more than one at bedtime or she will wake me up for her to get a drink of water."

It calms him an hour afterwards.,,,This occupies my 12 wk puppy for 20-30 minutes until he ferociously finishes it. My arms are saved from being bitten bloody during that time and for awhile after... so price is well worth it. The oils in the chew seem to numb his mouth. I have a high bite drive puppy from police line. Normal puppies could make this last much longer. He loves it far more than antler, bones, or skins (which are less appetizing than arms). It is safe for my dog to go wild on. Perhaps make sure your puppy is smart enough to gag himself should he shove down throat. ?"

They last a decent amount of time with him. The adult dogs want nothing to do with the scent of them, but they are for the puppy anyhow. :)I can only give these a 1 star as I am unable to rate how well they stand up to chewing as the dogs won’t touch these, I believe it’s because of the flavor. Personally they smell delicious, but it’s pretty strong pumpkin smell so maybe it’s off putting to the dogs."

This keeps her well occupied and would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a healthy chew for a pup.

A welcome change from some treats that smell horrible, if you know what I mean.2) I have two chihuahua puppies who NEVER sit still and who are NEVER quiet. Since giving them each a treat, I have enjoyed a full hour of total silence. They initially went NUTS over the treats, running all over the house waving them around-- then settled in and started chewing. They haven't stopped since. It's worth the asking price just to see them so content!3) The puppies obviously love the flavor. I'm buying more immediately. Hopefully this will keep them from chewing on furniture for a while..."

Keep in mind she did not chew it the entire time and by the time we arrived it was in 3 separate pieces.She did like the flavor, but durability is not its strong suit.She is a very aggressive chewer for her size, giving her lots of chew toys has kept her away from my furniture legs which she originally would naw on when she was a puppy.A little vicks vapor rub (buy the knock off from the $ store) on the legs of anything she was not supposed to chew on and supplying her with Nylabone chew toys for aggressive chewers has kept us all happy.

We think she was hiding it for later, to enjoy peacefully when nobody was around. I've never seen her getting so excited about a treat in these past few years, this was such a surprise!

Her teeth have been rundown by years of chewing on dog treats but guess what no cavities! Honestly I don't think I will be buying these again! Too pricey for the amount they give you!

Seriously, they smell like cloves and cinnamon and my dog absolutely loves them! I bought them because he's a persistent beggar and I'm a big pushover and since he's already overweight, I needed to find a low calorie treat for him. He eats them pretty fast, so I wish they lasted a little longer. And like all quality dog chews, they're not cheap. But if he likes them and they won't add to his weight problem, I'm all in!"

My 3 year old chihuahua mix is sooo picky that I have a hard time finding foods/treats that she'll actually touch. I have bought her dental sticks from Greenies, treats from Blue Buffaloe, and many other treats that most dogs I know love but everytime I offer them to her, she gives me this look like ""Really? You want me to eat that??"" She also doesn't like hard treats or treats that are bigger than a dime. But she'll eat these all by herself and not expect me to make it into smaller pieces! Plus, the ingredients are great and it's made in the USA. Couldn't ask for anything better. It's a chew toy, dental stick, and treat."

The vet is very pleased at their weight loss, and switching over from higher calorie treats to these Naked Grain sticks has helped immensely. True, they don't last long, but my dogs are 30-40 pounds each, so I didn't expect them to last a long time. A smaller pup might enjoy these for a bit more. I love the price since with 2 dogs always on the lookout for a treat, I need to have some at the ready at all times."

She is 6 years old and had her first dental a couple months ago and the vet said her teeth were in ""amazing shape"" especially with her being a poodle mix and poodles tend to have dental issues.  Not only that, her teeth are crooked.  All she required was a cleaning.  I do not brush her teeth but rely solely on this product to remove tarter and keep her teeth cleaned.  Mission accomplished!"

She recently went in for her annual exam and my vet was shocked on how good her teeth looked.  I highly recommend these."

The dogs really liked these and were able to devour them pretty quickly.  They did take slightly longer to chew than a normal dental stick, however.  The ingredients are not super alarming, though I don't think they are quite as good as our usual brand.  If you have a dog over 50 pounds, these are pretty easy to serve.  However, you are supposed to give dogs under 50 pounds less than a full ring a day, and these are rather hard to break.  You may be able to cut them, but I didn't think to try that because I have large dogs, so I am not sure how well that would work.  Each ring is 112 kcals, which is slightly more than the kind we usually use, so I like to give these only occasionally.  The bag does list all of the important information I look for; ingredients, guaranteed analysis, calorie content, feeding guidelines and expiration date. The dogs did not have any adverse reactions to these dental rings.  Though I don't feel this is the healthiest option out there, the dogs really loved them and the treats are not super unhealthy so I will probably keep these on as an occasional option to change up our daily routine."

Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,My dogs absolutely loved the flavor of these,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2023","N-Bone Adult Dental Rings Chicken Flavor Dog Treats were a huge hit with my boys. Even though the rings were made for adult dogs, they kept my two puppies busy for quite a while and took care of their ""itchy"" teeth; so these are perfect for teething puppies. The dental rings don't have a strong smell like bull pizzle or pig ears, additionally, they are free of many common allergens and the rings did an excellent job of reducing doggie breath, especially my oldest dog's ""guess what I found in the backyard"" breath. These chicken rings are definitely going into our treat rotation.The Bottom Line: The 7-count bag of N-Bone Chicken Flavor Adult Dog Dental Rings sells for $9.88, which is just $1.41 per treat which is less expensive, per treat, than the bulk treats at my LPS."

I like the ingredients (mostly rice flour and gelatin, no weird ingredients), and they take a bit more time to chew than the usual dental chews I give them.  These did not cause any upset stomachs.The ingredients of these n-bones are pretty similar to those of Twistix, which I've been giving my dogs for years and years as well as the dogs for whom I dogsit.  So far no one has gotten an upset stomach from those, and I'm sure they'll be fine with these as well.  I like that there are no artificial colors in these!  Dogs do not care how their treats look!They're a bit big for my 20lb dog, although not if you ask him.  I was hoping I'd be able to break these rings in half, but they're way too hard to break.

However, I can say that my dog absolutely loved these. When we sat the first treat down, we weren't sure what to expect, bc he can be picky about treats. Our expectation was that he would take a few minutes to gnaw on the treat or he wouldn't eat it at all. To our surprise, he almost inhaled the whole thing...and he did that every time he got one.

They are on the large side and keep her occupied for a good amount of time. They come in a resealable bag. My dog is medium size and while she didn’t chew these up super-fast, they didn’t last a super long time either. She seemed to enjoy them and gets excited when I grab the bag."

Each ring is about 3.5”-4” in width and about ¼” thick and are pretty solid to the touch. It’s recommended that these are for dogs older than 1. We have 2 dogs- a pit bull and a Frenchie who can both chew threw almost anything. They ate these rings in about 2 minutes so they didn’t get much chewing time out of them unfortunately. I gave them one every other day until we ran out of the pack. I did notice a difference in their breath smelling better however I didn’t notice any changes in tartar or plaque build up but that’s probably because my dogs chew them too quickly. Overall, these are nice healthy treats for dogs and I would recommend them for dogs who aren’t fast chewers."

My little dogs took their time chewing (30 minutes) but my husky ate hers rather quickly, in about 5 minutes.  The only con I saw was the instructions said to give one of my dogs 1/4 of a ring and the other 2 dogs 1/2 a ring.  These are rather hard so I'm not sure how they expect someone to do 1/4 or 1/2."

Per the directions, based on his size, I give him one-half a ring each day. It took me a bit to figure out how to break it in two - we squeeze it until it snaps, rather than trying to bend it. Our pup loves it so much that he whimpers by the pantry door when he's finished it. It doesn't last long, though. I also don't know how well it will work for his teeth, but it certainly can't hurt. I'd recommend this based on how much my dog likes it, and then you can monitor the health of your pup's teeth."

I like these rings because being made primarily from rice powder and think they are likely easier to digest than regular chews.  I also like the ring shape because she has to break it into smaller pieces before eating the treats.  I can't give her bully sticks because she'll eat large pieces at once instead of chewing them.  These rings seem to taste good to her too.  She won't chew on things that don't have a strong flavor and she was so happy the first time I took one out of the bag.

Though I was turned off by the texture, the dog loved it.  She was quick to eat the whole thing- so quick that I doubt there is any dental benefits.  These are sold as a one-size-fits all, but medium and small dogs are directed to eat less than a ring a day.  This means you would need to part out the circle, which then gives them an end to easily chew on and it's gone in no time.  They did fine with the pups digestion, but was not long lasting or easy to feed if you have a small/med dog."

B0B8L31J68,Radar626,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good chewies, but not long lasting","Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2022","These are good chewy treats for dogs, as they have a decent list of ingredients and our dog didn't seem to mind eating it. He's not a picky eater, but there are some treat flavors he won't eat. It didn't take him long to  make this ring-shaped chew disappear, maybe a full minute if that.  The package may say it's for 'strong' chewers, but it sure doesn't seem like it. Maybe it's also based on dog size?  Our American Bulldog is a big chonker, and he chewed through this treat like it was nothing more than a marshmallow. Our little ten pound Min Pin mix took a lot longer to devour her piece, but she also didn't have any trouble biting through the treat. Price here on Amazon is certainly better than the box box pet stores, where these bags sell for at least twice the price (at least around here in NY well outside of the city). We've bought these rings before as our A.B. loved their puppy teething rings when he was that age. They also have a pumpkin flavor, but we've yet to come across ANY dog - be it our own or that of friends or family or even shelter pups - that like that flavor.  But the chicken flavored chewy rings, like these, are quickly taken after a cursory sniff. Because of the higher calorie content, our dog only gets one or two a week and only on the days when we know he will be getting extra exercise."

B01HGMDO2U,Katie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ready for a long story?,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2020","Well you’re here reading so I guess you are. Six years ago I decided to adopt cat. I didn’t know which one yet just that I wanted a cat in my life. I went to a local shelter and found one that I liked a lot. When I talked to the clerk there she told me that the little guy I liked was really sick, and that their vet couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him. I got nervous about the costs associated with an undiagnosed illness, and when I made my thoughts known the clerk said “he’s not the cat for you.” I gave her this look of “excuse me?” And she continued saying, “when it’s your cat, you’ll know. And you won’t care what’s wrong or how much the medical bills might be, you’ll just know.” She suggested I go check out a couple other places and that if my heart was truly set on this little guy I could come back for him. Turns out she was right. He wasn’t the little guy for me, although I’m sure he found a very happy home. I went to another shelter that day and when I walked in, I turned to the cat room (it was very small and had no door) and started to go in. I remember the shelter was really loud. It was small so there wasn’t much of a barrier between the dogs and cats. But over all the chaotic noise I just heard this heartbreaking meow. I looked at the back of the room and there was this little grey floof meowing at the top of his lungs, standing up on his hind legs just staring at me. I immediately went over and got him out of the cage, and didn’t put him down again until we got home. I didn’t even ask if he’d had health issues, because that clerk was right. I didn’t care. Little did I know I chose a floof (named Jasper) that would end up with some serious health issues, costing around $6000 for the hospital stay and surgery, and expensive prescription food thereafter. Jasper had crystals in his bladder that he was unable to pass through his urethra. He almost died when it was at its worst, and even though it was suggested to me to put him down, I told the vet to try anything he could to save him. The surgery has a 50% success rate which is not great, but it was a success for Jasper. However, he now needs some special care to ensure he stays healthy. Although the prescription food helped immensely, I noticed he was still having digestive issues, and has had a couple of flare ups with his bladder. I tried so many different things but nothing really worked until I found these random cranberry treats on amazon. I figured, what the heck. Might as well. And they were a godsend. Not only is Jasper OBSESSED with these treats, but they help him so much! As long as I consistently give him these treats he doesn’t get bladder flare ups, and he throws up a lot less (now it’s just the occasional hairball for which I started using Loxatene). In general they just keep him much healthier and happier, and they’re ten times better than the royal canine prescription treats. A few months back they stopped selling these, and immediately Jasper started having some issues again. I’m so glad they’re back in stock, and I hope they stay that way. If your cat has urinary tract issues, I am begging you, try these! It is absolutely and by far the best product for kitty UT issues on the market. Quality ingredients, and proven to work. And for the record, I am not being paid or sponsored for this review. I just truly truly believe in this company and these treats after everything Jasper and I have been through. Anyway, if you’ve gotten this far, thanks for reading, and try the treats."

B01HGMDO2U,AB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cat loves eating these like candy!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2023","So I cannot attest to the flavor quality as I have not eaten these myself but my chonky boy cat really enjoys gobbling them down like gummy bears. As he's getting on his years and UTIs are an issue for male cats I try to give these to him daily. At 16 lbs he gets about 12 of these per day, I throw them across the room and he screams joyfully as he flies upwards, getting several feet of air. Sometimes one gets under a bookcase and then he goes mad trying to pry his precious out from under the thieving piece of furniture. I don't dare go near the bag when it's not Treat Time as he will get all riled up and becomes utterly unbearable.The weird thing is initially when I first got these he did not care for them. I didn't give him any for a few weeks and suddenly he developed a taste for them, I'm not sure what kitty crack they put in these things.My other cat does not care for these. One sniff and she turns to me with this annoyed face like I'm wasting her valuable cat-time.So your cat's reactions to this will vary (every kitty is an individual and she/he has different preferences). If they don't like it, try again later or give it to another fellow cat owner to enjoy.Edit: I have updated my review from 4 stars to 5 stars.It's 10 months since my previous review and my cat still loves them! And they help keep his weight down as we have made a game where I shake the bag (and he gets all crazy because he has the exact sound of the bag memorized) before throwing the treat for him to catch/find. I throw him a couple throughout the day so he gets his 9-12 minimum and they keep him active and healthy. The treats are also a nice small size so he doesn't have to struggle at all (senior kitties sometimes have teeth issues so he tries and gives up on the bigger treats that require chewing). I hope the company never changes the formula!"

B01HGMDO2U,Joy M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cats line up for this,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2023","All of my three cats love this. They would line up and wait for their treat once I shake the bag. My only issue is that there isn't that much in the bag, especially if you have 3 cats all weighing between 9 to 13 lbs. I would have to give them 7-8 per day, and my ginger cat, 9-12 treats a day. This would definitely finish within a week or so. Also in the packaging, it doesn't mention anything about how it supports and promotes good urinary tract health, or anything with the word ""urinary tract"". I guess it's just self-explanatory that cranberry is good for the urinary tract."
B01HGMDO2U,Farook Koehler,2.0 out of 5 stars,Treats That Aren't,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023","We have a couple older kitties, and we've transitioned them to ""urinary health"" diets. This means out with the old treats (which were likely okay), and in with treats for cats with FLUTD.Our cats totally ignored these treats. Even when hungry, they hardly even sniff them, and have not eaten a single treat. So, one can infer that at least some cats don't like these alleged ""treats"". From that, one can safely conclude that for those cat owners, this is $6 wasted.Yes, cats can be persnickety, and maybe change their minds about things. Our cats are somewhere in the middle of that continuum, but when it's dinner time, and the treats aren't even sniffed at, I think that's a good sign that the treats ... aren't ""treats"".I should also mention that we've tried many different brands of treats down through the years, and none have been so roundly rejected as these. So, you can take your chances buying these. They are roughly double the price of typical treats."
B01HGMDO2U,Cynister,3.0 out of 5 stars,unfortunately my cats did not like,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2023",my cats who are not usually very picky wouldnt eat them. I mixed them with food and other treats - they picked the other away and left these.
B01HGMDO2U,Faizan Mohammad,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved my cat's health!!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2023","My cat is a 13 y/o( female) himalayan, and she's been struggling with chronic cystitis for over a year now. She has recurrent UTI's and has regular visits to the vet for antibiotic courses to treat the infections, but she has generally been very low energy and strains to pee quite often. I bought these treats as a last ditch effort to see if the cranberries could help keep the acidity up in her urinary tract to prevent bacterial growth because that's a home remedy my mom brought up for when people get UTIs as well. After a week of feeding her these treats and not changing her diet/any other significant lifestyle factors, her personality and mood and urinary habits have transformed significantly, and I'm so happy she's doing better. I didnt realize that there were also so many vitamins in these treats too, and I think they've also helped make a big difference. If your cat has recurrent urinary issues, I think these are worth giving a try!!"

B01HGMDO2U,AnneV,5.0 out of 5 stars,Will eliminate bacteria for kitty UTI,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","My cat was peeing all over and howling.  Naturally she was trying to tell me she was sick.  She had blood in her urine and I bought these same day and fed her like a prescription 8-9 treats 3 times a day.  By day 3, I would have taken her to the vet, but she started drinking more water(I put 1 large coffee mug of water on each of my night stands) as she likes to hang out in my bed.  I would suggest more water bowls where they are, as she wouldn’t walk to the kitchen for her water fountain! Baby was sick. Like humans we don’t get out of bed sick.  These are absolutely a game changer and my pet insurance many pets pays for these as a holistic treat option.  I now give her these daily for maintenance to help bacteria in the urine along with Iams uti food or a UTI food. Like a regular antibiotic they take time to full heal.  Per medical medium- cranberry is a natural antibiotic for streptococcus bacteria which causes UTI.All the best with your fur baby-Ms. Nika’s mommy"

When I returned from work the next day, the cats had destroyed the bag and all the treats were gone."
B01HGMDO2U,C. Tsiokos,2.0 out of 5 stars,Iffy for urinary tract and product integrity,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2023","I tried these treats in hope of replacing Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Adult Cat Treats, which can be very difficult to find. My cat's on a strict urinary tract health diet and I supplement his regular food with treats throughout the day.He didn't go for these at first, which was an early bad sign as he usually gobbles up treats. Ingredients say these have chicken as the primary ingredient, which he loves. So it's curious why he wouldn't take to them. After a couple more tries, he started eating them, but didn’t seem too enthusiastic.Another issue: I ordered 3 bags to take advantage of a 3-for-the-price-of-2 checkout coupon. I got 3 bags, but only 2 contained the full 2.5 ounces of treats. The 3rd bag is about a third full, despite being in the same packaging as the other two. It clearly doesn't contain the listed 2.5 ounces. It's not that big a deal, considering I paid for 2 and got a little more than 2 bags' worth, but still, it makes me question if the company's not playing fast and loose in other ways.And, as others have noted, despite the Amazon listing, there's nothing on the product's packaging that specifically says these treats are good for a urinary tract health diet. Are they really? Can you believe the ingredient listing at all?Considering these issues together, it makes me question if I can trust the company and their product claims. It all seems shady. Therefore I don't think I'll ever order these again for my cat."
B01HGMDO2U,Kristen S,4.0 out of 5 stars,I really don't know if these will help any cat who has urinary problems,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2018","I honestly can't rate these cat treats on how they affect a cats urinary health. My cat never had any urinary problems before eating these, and she has none now either. The treats themselves are crunchy, small and heart shaped. My cat doesn't love these (like she does some others... as she's ""tempted"" by another kind). She is though happy to have something different than just her regular food. These are well priced, although I'd like to make a suggestion to you all. I have purchased a bag of dry food, different than her regular, daily kibble (I bought it here, on Amazon). I use it as a ""treat"" for her, and whatever I give her, I subtract the same amount from her daily ration. This way, she thinks that she's getting her treats, but won't put on extra weight (which so many cats do, for this reason alone). It'll also save ALOT of money considering, for instance that a five pound bag of dry food would equal more than 20 bags of treats. Whoa, that's alot of money! My daughter turned me on to this idea, and I think she's pretty amazing for thinking of it. I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy these, especially if their cat does have urinary issues. But, I can't say that they would have any effect on it. Possibly checking with your cat's vet might be a good idea."

I have a 2+ year old hydrocephalus cat and he has had bouts with bladder stones 3 times.  Twice he was hospitalized.  After the second bout, we were doing really well but I think I got lax after a year had passed.  He started sneaking the other cat's food and the dog's food.  He recently got blocked again and was hospitalized.  I swore this time I would be as vigilant as I could for the rest of his life.  But ... he liked his food and treats and the variety ... so I got him 3 different kinds of urinary food and a bunch of treats.  These were a new brand to me.  I like that they don't have wheat, corn, and soy.  Taste-wise, they are cat approved.  I will continue to give these to him and have no regrets."

Pretty much the only way I can get him to run is to throw a treat he likes, and he does chase after these. I would guesstimate the number of treats per bag to be between 150-200, which would last close to a month if you're following the recommended schedule for a 5-10 lb. cat, but maybe only 2 weeks for a cat larger than 10 lbs."

Thank goodness I caught it at the early stage.  After two nights at the vet' s we were able to bring him home.  The vet told us that our cat needed to be on special food that is good for his condition.  I got to thinking about treats and realized that the treats we were giving him weren't good for him.  Fhese cranberry treats are great!They are great! Having had UTI problems myself, I knew the cranberry would be great for him.  He loves them!"

I stay within the recommended ""no more than 9 treats per day"" and it is working well.  This is a journey to good health for the cat and we hope these treats help in this adventure."

I'm thinking after trying everything else it is solving their UI problems and stopping the aggression and bullying. I know animals attack other animals that have health issues but one one kitty that was struggling with UI problems and having lost a kitty by going to a vet that insisted on a rabies shot before treating then I having done several antibiotics, changed food, etc. this seems to be the ticket for him. I hope this keep the cranberry in it or I will look elsewhere for treats that do have it."
B01HGMDO2U,Anne M. Helmenstine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful (If Your Cat Will Eat Them),"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2018","My young male cat had blood in his urine, couldn't void completely, and had crystals. Honestly, I didn't think he'd make it. It's a multi-cat household, so I didn't catch his problem until it was dire. We already had a cat fountain, but added water dishes throughout the house and immediately switched to Purina Pro Plan for urinary health (he refuses wet food). One weird trick that worked to increase hydration was to sprinkle water onto cat grass before letting him nibble it. I ordered these treats because he loves snacks and already felt deprived from the new food and miserable from the crystals. I was told eating smaller meals more frequently helps control urine pH. He loves them! I have to hide the bag so he won't bite into it and help himself. I can't say whether the snacks help, but they don't appear to hurt. He's on the mend and is even playing with the other cats. However, if you're on the fence about these treats, it's true they are a love or hate thing. While the cat with urinary issues loves these, every other cat rejects them. I don't know whether there is something in them the one cat instinctively senses will help or he's just less picky. The size of the treats and crunch factor seems about the same as other treats. The recommended daily amount for a small cat is 5-6 per day (twice that for a large cat), so while the package is small, I think they will last a while. The ingredient list looks healthy, so I feel good giving them to him."

He's been to the emergency vet more times than I can count due to this issue. This cat is a carb addict and refuses wet food, so I have to settle with a kibble designed for urinary tract health. Recently, I decided to get him on a VERY high, very expensive quality dry kibble. After several weeks on the new food and after multiple tests with a pH strip, I started noticing the pH of his urine became very basic instead of acidic, which is where it needs to be. I decided I'd try these to see if it helped so I could keep him on the new food because I adore the ingredients. I fed him the serving size every day for a week, continued testing his urine and didn't notice a difference in the pH. I think all these did was just make him a little fatter. Great. So I had to switch him back to Iams, which works WONDERS! Just don't care for some of the ingredients.Giving 3 stars for the taste, because he goes crazy when I open the bag."

Or I have to mix with her food, keep the other cats away from it, and watch while holding breath hoping she'll eat it all not notice.  So I tried this.  I was surprised she actually seemed to love it and she's a picky eater. Of course, all cats are different, but at least mine liked it.  It wasn't a miracle cure and I almost did four stars, but she gradually started to have an easier time on the litter box and now it's been several weeks since I've noticed a problem so I guess she's cured for now.  I even have some left.  I keep telling myself I should give them to her more often for maintenance.  But bottom line, it seemed to work for my cat.  I can't know if she would have gotten better anyway, but she did get better."

Always up until then he was perfect with the litter box but because he felt so bad he had to show us how he was feeling, we were beside ourselves on what to do. Finally I did some research and found these treats, I figured if cranberry was good for this problem in people maybe it would work on the cat. Since we started giving him these treats he is back to his old self! No blood in his urine, no whimpering because he is in pain, and no tinkling outside the box. I can't praise these enough! For the record he is already on prescription UTI food and it also didn't seem to solve the problem. These did! I hope my review helps another family in search of a solution for this problem."

I was actually looking for something to put in her food for her kidneys sinces she old and has slightly elevated kidney levels. These were super affordable so I decided there's no harm in trying them. She absolutely loves these treats. Everytime I open a bag of anything she gets excited and thinks it's these treats. I'm using these to train her to sit in laps. They smell kind of good and not gross like cat food does. As far as if they are helping her kidneys I don't know but she really, really likes them. I hope she doesn't get bored of them."

Thanks, guys. Do you know the emotional distress you are inflicting on my addicted cats? I don’t know how to break it to them...Two out of two cats agree that these are delicious! Are they really healthier? I don’t know. I hope so. I feel better giving them these than most other treats out there. (They have to be better than those garbage pail ingredient treats, right?) All I know is my boys freak out when the red package appears. They gobble them up without hesitation. We should probably just have these on a subscription at this point!"

They are lighter in color than before.  My cats loved them before and would beg for more. But with this new batch they won’t eat them and one will not even come to see what I have for her because she knows they are not as good as before. They are NOT RETURNABLE OR REFUNDABLE so only buy  one to see if your cat will like it. I’m stuck with 6 now that my cats won’t eat. (My usual order for my 3 cats) I’m wondering if they even have the urinary tract ingredients that are advertised. I’m looking for something else now.

They are definitely not her favorite (Vital Cat minnows and steamed fish are top tier in this house) but she’ll eat them. I don’t give her the recommendation on the package, I offer her 2-4 treats every other day. They are small, bite size, not stinky and offer some crunch."

(If he didn't, though, would that be reason to leave a negative review?  I don't think so.)By combining with a switch to a  readily available UT formula food, we managed to avoid a visit to the vet.  (Also we enticed our cat to drink extra puddles of water for a few days.). He is good as new now.Long story short, these have been added to daily routine and we've added them to subscribe n save.You know that this review is anecdotal and not scientific, right?"

She loved them and the treatment worked quickly.Interestingly, now that she’s feeling better she hates the treats! She won’t eat them at all. I have a feeling that when she wasn’t feeling well she instinctively knows what foods, minerals & vitamins she needs to get better.These treats should be sold in smaller bags considering they’re medicinal."

So I bought these, Iams dry cat food to support urinary function, and HomeoPet Feline UTI+ drops. I knew I wasn't going to be able to directly administer the drops, so I made sure that she liked these cranberry treats, and She Did! So, then I put the homeopet drops, one on each treat, and she ate those too! 3 days have gone by and I no longer smell the strong urine smell. So, I will keep them both on the new Iams, and buy more of these treats for regular use. Very happy, and so is Miss Munchkin!"

I also had my vet look at the ingredients and she said it looks fine.  I didn't realize I wasn't giving him as many as they suggest so will give him more now but trying to keep him from getting more than his current 15lbs.  I think my only complaint is these aren't available in a larger size. an 8oz or 1 lb bag would be great if the company reads our reviews."

My vet told me to stop giving him treats as well. I felt bad that I had to take away all of his treats so I was researching for treats that can help with urinary issues.There are not a lot of options out there so I purchased Get Naked, Purina Pro Plan, and Royal Canin treats. My cat wasn't too fond of any of the treats but absolutely did not like the Get Naked treats. He tolerated the Royal Canin.The treats were worth a try. Too bad there are not any urinary treats in the market for cats that are soft in texture."

Hes ok now, but he continued having some issues after arriving back home for almost a week. Aside from changing his diet, one of the things I did was buy him these treats instead of the usual stuff I normally get at the grocery store. He absolutely loves these! I can't definitively say that they're doing anything for him medically because I'm not a vet or a cat, but at least the odds that these treats would contribute to another blockage are slim and I feel better knowing that cranberry does have a proven track record of helping people."

Female and young-ish, so I had a feeling it was a UTI. I bought these to try to help at least a little with keeping her clear after her $700 trip to the emergency vet. I can't say for certain that these are super helpful, but my cat really likes the taste/crunch and they give me some peace of mind"

My eldest cat has to be tricked into eating these with coverups and additives. But my other boy just gobbles them up and askes for more. However I think it has something to do with how hard the treats are, maybe they're too hard for one to like. Don't know if that's a freashness thing or not seeing how some peices aren't as hard as other pieces in the same bag."

My other cat will eat them, but doesn’t seem crazy about them.I bough these to ensure my cats’ urinary tract health, and while the description for the Amazon listing currently says they’re for urinary health, the bag is labeled as a general “cat health with cranberry.” Either the bag or the Amazon listing needs some updating."

I also have to be very careful with what she eats - including treats! She loves these! They are heart shaped and not very thick but crunchy! Obviously I have no idea how they taste - but if she eats them they must be pretty good! And , knock on wood, she hasn't had another UTI in quite some time!!! I have changed a few things so I can't say it's just from these treats but they definitely help! And I have them on auto-renewal to ship monthly!!"

I always watch what I put into my animal's bodies so the ingredients of this treat were very nice. My eight year old Domestic Shorthair loves them. This is Dip's first time trying a crunchy treat and after me persuading her to eat them, she now loves them. My ten year old Russian Blue doesn't like treats at all and she doesn't like human food so I knew she wouldn't try these. But my DS still loves them and I am a happy cat owner knowing that these treats are healthy for her and her kidneys. Will definitely recommend to friends and will buy again when needed."

I put them on a tall wrought iron trellis and can't remove to return because my trailing flowers have grown all around the wires and lights.  Come fall I will remove and return to company, and hopefully they will replace.  I truly believe this third set was just defective, as the other two sets are still working and really are pretty.  If anyone from the company is reading this, please contact me.  I would love the replacement now to complete the look of my garden patio.  I can only give three stars due to the defective third set.

Amazing choice when the cat is tired of eating the same urinary treats!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2021",I see a bunch of reviews on here that made me uneasy to buy but the reviews were of people who knew their cats were picky so they gave this product a 4 or lower because of the cats pickiness which isn’t fair to the company. The product is very high quality! My cat absolutely loves the treats. I’m guessing the cranberry in it is his favorite! Not many treats when your cats have urinary problems but this is amazing!

I’ve always been cautious but one got it last year. I always used a Drinkwell fountain and they drink plenty of water but didn’t matter. Now I feed them anti-urinary food, wet and dry, and now kitty treats. Lol, it cost me a lot 1k to have my cat treated for blockage so the extra cost for special food and treats is well worth it.

That means a variety of taste buds and plenty of individuality.With that said, nobody liked these.  A couple would eat a few of them occasionally, but in general, they just got a sniff before stalking off in disgust.We have a couple of cats with tendencies towards urinary tract problems.  It was a great idea, but if they won't eat them, it's pointless.  (Neither of our UTI cats will touch them.)  Maybe some cats will be more interested, but at our house, they were a bust."

I desperately needed an effective way to improve my older dog's teeth (and Bark Bright REALLY works!) but I didn't want to spend that much on my puppy yet ($25/month) nor did I want her to have 75+ extra calories (although I did a few times break the Bark Bright sticks in smaller halves for her when I didn't have alternative yet).These puppy chews seem to be tasty to BOTH my dogs, and they are always happy to have them.  They do not last more than A MINUTE or TWO (maybe 2 with my puppy, but definitely less than 1 minute for my 7 year old husky shepherd mix).These are ""small"" and there are about 16-18 sticks per bag, so they are a good alternative (only about 27 calories per stick) for my puppy as my older dog gets his Bark Bright stick every morning.  I get the Joint Health ones in this brand as a back up/snack for both dogs and they both also love to get them (follow me, sit alert and wait for them!) every single time."

She absolutely ADORES these. I have tried the Whimzies puppy dental chews as well as one other brand and, none of them got quite a reaction out of my puppy as the Get Naked brand. I also really love that they are helping to provide my girl with the proper nutrients she needs while developing. They are a bit small, however, for a growing large breed puppy and, expensive when you factor in that you should be feeding them to your dog twice a day. Additionally, I greatly love that these dental treats are made in the US."

We spend a lot of money on dental work for her, because even with regular teeth brushing and check ups, her age and genetics gave my poor senior dog serious teeth problems. For my puppy, I like that she's getting her teeth cleaned while giving me 20 minutes of respite from her antics. Nice to see her chomp on something other than my bum or ankles :). Yay! My senior dog with missing teeth takes about 40 minutes, but she looks forward to it every day. We're happy when she's happy! We still brush her teeth daily, but it's great that she gets as much support as possible for her dental health.

Smells like mint chocolate to me, (it doesn't contain chocolate). I don't think this cleans teeth very well, so make sure to be brushing your dogs teeth regularly (as any responsible dog parent should be). This does however, do wonders for stinky breath. If you're not brushing your dog's teeth then the smell may continue despite using these, due to the plaque buildup. But overall just pair these with daily brushing, and your dog's teeth will be shining! (and smell good too)"

He’s super healthy and a smarty pants too... not sure if there’s a direct correlation to the chews but you never know?!The sticks last him a while... he usually eats some of it and then comes back to it the next day or so.

They are her favorite and she'll do quite a bit to earn one. They seem to satisfy her insatiable chewing problem (at least for a few minutes), and her teeth are sparkly white with very little tartar build up. I like that they have GOOD things inside, not random yucky bits like so many dog treats. We've gone through ten packs of these in various flavors and will continue to buy them for her as long as she continues to love them (we rotate flavors so she doesn't get bored). She seems to like these pink ones the most, but never turns away the other flavors (and she does turn away other brands of dental chews!). They are the ONLY treat that will get her to come back inside the fence when she's escaped, as well."

I have to watch what treats I give her because she usually throws up to MOST OF THEM! It has been now 5 months since I have been getting these chews and she has not thrown up AT ALL. I give her one before bedtime and she goes crazy when she sees me pull out the dental chew from the bag. Since she is 7 months now, I will be moving on to the Skin and Coat Dental Chews to try them. I love this brand!"

I do not regret my choice. Jasper absolutely loves them and I am happy to treat him with these without worrying about them not being appropriate for his age. He's had no touble with digestion, but I do limit him to 2 per day.  If he had his way, I truly believe he'd eat the whole bag!"

I tear the stick in half to give him half after his breakfast, and one after his dinner.To me they kind of smell like chocolate almond milk!  Mmm!!  I almost want to try one, haha, very cool!  Feels like I'm spoiling my pup when I give him these, but they're so good for helping with the  puppy breath!  Not many dental sticks say if they're okay for puppies, especially with a little guy like mine.  Just wanted to be safe.  He started on these since he was 11 weeks.  Seems to help with his pottys too!When I ran out of the first bag, I ordered two more.  Wish the stores around here sold them, but I can always just order them here.  :)"

Over all I am very happy with this purchase and so is Honey"
B01JONK8Q4,Kimberly  Lewis,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I could give 5 stars!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2022","I’m so sad to have to write this review! Our puppy has LOVED these chews since the time we brought her home, however we’ve realized they’re making her sick. She’ll have bouts of throwing up all her food after she eats, and though it’s partially due to her fast eating, we’ve observed that it’s always after she’s had a chew stick the night before. Might work better for other dog breeds, but our sweet bernedoodle is a no go :("
B01JONK8Q4,abc,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too hard,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023",I have been buying these for a long time.

B01JONK8Q4,SC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2018","My little dog loves these. I wanted a sort of doggy breakfast i can give my pup in the morning while i'm getting ready for work. Something that is good for her but won't make her fat and would help with her teeth. These fit the bill. They are very low calorie, made with quality ingredients, are good for her teeth and make her breath smell minty fresh.And, my puppy thinks these are a treat! I tried giving her the greenies before and she wanted nothing to do with them. But these, she begs for. So we are both happy. She gets one every morning and its the perfect size and amount for her."

He's very picky when it comes to chew sticks. Many are too hard for him and he gives up or he's done in 2 seconds. He's in that ""landshark"" period where he bites and chews at everything - so, I've been searching for something to satisfy him and help with that, while not making him sick. He's been getting 1 stick a day for over a week and loves them! It distracts him for a bit and we have had no issues in regards to sick or diarrhea. I highly recommend these and will continue buying them throughout his puppy stages."

The ingredients are all natural and my puppy loves them. I wish more people knew about these instead of pedigree dentastix. These are so much better for your puppy and around the same price. I was giving my puppy the nylabone nutri dent chews. I didn't have a problem with them however, I came across these and they sounded like a good idea to try. These do smell like peppermint but my puppy still enjoyed it and after his breath smelled like peppermint so it really doesn't bother me. I will continue to buy these as my puppies daily dental stick."

I only give these to him when he needs to be occupied and he really really enjoys them.I wouldn’t give these to larger puppies or to puppies who have a tendency to be a tough chewer, as it could pose as a choking hazard, but all chews should be supervised anyways."

She's still being introduced to so many things, and we're learning her preferences, but these quickly became the favorite and you can tell in every way. We started giving them to her when she was about 8 weeks old, and they would last for hours, even days. Now, she can devour one in 30 minutes.  For something that lasts longer, try the puppy rings. But these are a hit for sure!"

She’s definitely teething and she will knaw into these things when she’s having a teething fit. She carried it around in her tiny mouth and brings it various places to continue chewing it throughout the day. One stick lasts her all day. I also love the scent of this! I thoroughly enjoy that it doesn’t smell like traditional treats and actually smells really good. I will definitely be buying more of these.

I buy dog treats and then usually cut them into smaller pieces to use in training.  These treats are sticks that are about 5 inches long and 1/4 inch in star shaped diameter.  I tried cutting them in smaller pieces but it was not easy!!  I used my sharpest knife but when I gave several to my dog, he tried to chew them but wasn't able to. He tried for several minutes but then just spit it out and walked away from it.  I have a miniature schnauzer.  I guess they might be OK for a larger dog.Sorry ""get naked"", but these are much too hard for my pup to chew.  I ordered a set of 3 bags and will be donating these to the local animal shelter and hoping I can find a softer treat to use in future training. Beth in Olympia"

He was teething very bad so I thought these could help him and I was a big fan of the natural ingredient claim with the added benefit. I made a mistake of not checking the ingredients. I don't understand who would put peppermint oil in a dog treat. This is absolutely toxic for any dog. Peppermint oil should not even be on your dog's skin let alone get ingested. I have been feeding this to my puppy for a few weeks now until I realized this. I am throwing them out immediately. I wanted to let people know out there that this is not good for your dog and it should not be fed to them. This company should really consider taking this ingredient out and then I may purchase this again.

I gave my pup one of the chicken flavored chew sticks this morning.  She chewed the stick in about 10 minutes and appeared to really enjoy it.  However, as soon as she finished, she immediately started to whine and cry, letting me know she wanted to get out of her crate.  I opened the crate and she ran to get a drink of water and headed right for the door.

It's a good size and my 9 pound Frenchie pup loves them. Supervise to make sure they don't eat more than recommended, the only drawback is how freaking expensive these are. I'll be loading up on store bought ones when we make the trip to our nearest stockist but as we are somewhat remote, the price is bearable until we can restock at the in-store price. Good quality and loved by my pup and my 9 year old Frenchie who likes to steal them and eat them in a few gulps. 🤪"

My 10 week old lab chewed through and ate this stick within 3 minutes of giving it to him. So if you do get these teething sticks for your pups, just be sure to watch them closely. It says 3 sticks daily for 16 to 25lb puppies, but I would not recommend that, as they are super thin and could potentially be a choking hazard. They do not have a strong smell as well."

I can’t actually give one of them a treat without giving both of them the same thing.

These sticks are kind of stinky, but she absolutely loves them. She wasn't doing as well with the rawhide twist sticks, she wasn't chewing them up enough before she tried to swallow the pieces, so I switched to these sticks. She chews these more thoroughly before swallowing, so she hasn't had any issues where I'm worried she's gonna choke."

B09R6PPRMH,Alan V,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for small puppies,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2023","As of writing this, I have a 8-week-old chihuahua puppy that's about 1-2 pounds. She is very hyperactive and bitey probably due to her teething, which has curbed her desire to bite everything within sight. If you have a bitey puppy, keep one of these on hand to have them chew on. In my opinion, they are a bit small, quite soft, and bendable. Because of that I always make sure to supervise my puppy while she's chewing on it just in case. It seems to last her a good amount, 1 per day for a 2-pound puppy. The recommendation on the back feels spot on so follow it."

We have two (2) ferrets and only one (1) liked these Bacon flavored treats.  We have purchased both the Chicken and Bacon flavored treats in the past. One thing to note. It seems that the company recently changed their Chicken flavored treat product. However, reading the ingredients for the older version and the new version, they are identical but the treats themselves are NOT the same. The Chicken flavored product used to be a brown color and both our ferrets loved those treats. We recently purchased the Chicken flavor treats again and they were the same dark brown (nearly black) color of the Bacon flavored treats. Now only one (1) of our ferrets like the Chicken so we stopped buying both the Chicken and Bacon treats."

They contain sweet potato as the second ingredient. Ferrets are obligate carnivores and cannot digest vegetables, starch, etc. They also contain vegetable glycerin (essentially sugar), and sugar has been shown to cause insulinoma and/or make it worse. Consider buying freeze-dried treats (there are some marketed for cats but only contain meat and are safe)."

Moore,5.0 out of 5 stars,He Loved Them At First,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","My new Shih Tzu puppy loved them when i first started giving him these. He would mow them down like a wood chipper! Lol They are a bit small or skinny so good size for even teacup size dogs like even below 3lbs( had a Yorkie that was 2 1/2lbs, Hadley, before i got Viserys, my Shih Tzu)but I would suggest that you watch or moderately supervise your dog while he/she eats them. I have heard reports that some dogs have choked or got them stuck in their mouths and throats. So to be safe, make sure your dog is in eyes view of you while he treats himself to these. They are apparently tasty to them. I started giving him the peanut butter ones for a bit of variety and now he won’t eat any more of both flavors. Lol I may have just gave them to him a bit too much and he got tired of them too quickly but everything seemed fine before the peanut butter ones. Came to find out he had been hiding them away in the folds of his bed. I go to clean his bed out and i find all these sticks! He was eating them at first seemed to love them. Idk what the heck happened. Dogs are finicky."

B00061URQA,Su Doki,4.0 out of 5 stars,Right size treats - wrong size dog!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2021","These little chew bones are perfect for a tiny, teacup puppy.  The bones are soft enough to bend without breaking. We purchased them for our 4-lb puppy. It looked like she had a cigarette (kinda funny!) and it lasted maybe 10 minutes. Then, we lost the bag somewhere in the house. Now that she's 8-lbs, it looks like she can eat the whole bag in one hour. The bones are about 1/4-inch wide. So, we are cutting the treats in half and putting them outside for the squirrels, who might find them too small too. To be fair, there are a good amount of treats in the bag. Our puppy was attracted to the flavor right away. But she is too big to enjoy its chewing fun and value. XXS puppies need teething treats too, which is why we gave it 4-stars."

The vet called her an aggressive chewer and told me not to give her anything hard because it's ruining her enamel and she's so young. So I took away her hard chew toys and she promptly chewed the legs on my end tables. So, I started giving her these and they only last her 10-15 minutes but when she's done she seems satisfied for a while. When she was a puppy these would last her an hour or longer."

B00061URQA,MTAmazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,For small dogs only!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2022","The packaging is very deceiving to me - they show a larger breed dog......I found these to be just barely large enough for my chihuahua puppy without having to worry about her choking on it once the stick is chewed down to a smaller size.  On a very positive note, works just perfect for a small breed baby."
B00061URQA,Angela,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not useful for large breed puppies,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2023","They are well loved as treats, but they are devoured in about 3 seconds (literally) by my 40 pound puppy. She’s 4 months old, so she can’t have big girl treats yet, and she’s still teething like crazy. I had hoped these would be chewier or stronger. I wanted her to have to gnaw on it a bit. But I have a feeling an 8 week old tea cup poodle would be the only puppy overwhelmed by these. Wish they had a variety of sizes or strengths."

The back of the package does outline how many you're allowed to give your puppy per their weight. Overall, the price is definitely worth it and does keep them occupied."

B00061URQA,DAOHIO,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Missnamed, but a good product for young puppies.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2017","I give one of these to my young puppy every night at bedtime.  Takes him just a couple of minutes to chew, but settles him right down and he knows it is part of the routine.  I wish they were just a little longer in length so that they would last longer, but they work okay for settling.  I don't think they do much for satisfying the need to chew, as there are better options for that, but they are a nice treat.  There are puppy teething rings made by this same company which last a bit longer - but they also cost more and you don't get very many in a package.  I use those when I have them for the same purpose of settling my puppy down at bedtime, but they also don't do much to satisfy the need to chew, despite the name of the product.  I think these sticks (and the rings) are best for very young puppies, no more than five months."

Due to longevity, I rated it a 4, however this could be completely acceptable for other households with smaller puppies than my goldendoodle, who seems to be growing rapidly. We have also tried the rings, which I would suggest for larger breed dogs. My dog not only preferred those, but they lasted significantly longer as well."

Many people also use them as a treat as they do get eaten very quickly and some would argue that they do not help for teething. I have two King Charles Cavaliers and used these for both when they were puppies and I also used them for the litter of pups we just had. For a small breed dogs and young pups these do work great for teething. I gave them to the pups when they started getting teeth and they were unable to ""eat"" them yet but they loved the taste and it did help them with teething. Once they got older and were able to eat them it was more of a reward yes but it still helped with their back teeth which take the longest time to ""pop out"". The momma and daddy dogs even tried to steal them because they are so yummy! I also like these because they are edible and are much healthier to eat then raw hides. I recommended these to all of the new owners of our pups!"

My cat loves these, I first bought them at a store and they were soft and she enjoyed teething on them.  Also she liked/likes to nurse on fingers, and these were a great distraction.  I ended up buying more online. These were much harder (probably older) but she loves playing fetch with them.  We play for like an hour a day.  They slide and roll beautifully and are light enough that although she is a small cat she can easily carry them, and even jump onto my bed/couch with them.  They are also cheap enough that I have a ton and don't have to pick up the couch 5 times a day to get them."

One will throw up if he gets more than 2-3 at one time, another looks at them and gives me a blank look as if asking “What did you just try to pawn off on me?”, and then there’s the third one that is all-the-treats-all-the-time. So I have a hard time finding treats that they will all like or at least two out of three. So what did they think of these?Smell (that’s mostly me): On the mild side. Didn’t really smell like chicken to me.Hard/soft: Very soft. Two of the cats seemed to eat them okay, but the one that’s missing most of her teeth had trouble with them.Taste (that’s them): they seemed a bit dubious and I think that might be down to the mild smell. While they did eat them, the toothless one was the slower of the three to jump on them.Overall: I like that this product is made in the USA and it’s for all life stages since ours range from 4-11yo.

B08KL4M5RK,Deb Mericle,4.0 out of 5 stars,Tough to break apart,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2023","We have a multiple dog household.A 12-year-old, and a three month old Australian shepherd/border collie mix.Well, when we give one a treat, we have to give both of them a treat. And I’ve learned they want the exact same treat.I am not strong enough to break this ring in pieces. So I give one to my older dog. She breaks it up. The little dog grabs a piece and runs.Of course all the other pieces get eaten by my 12 year old dog.Since I don’t have the flexibility to give them smaller pieces, it gives the older dog much more of this treat at one time than I would prefer.Both of my dogs devour this in record time.  No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household. Or maybe if you had an older dog who did not want every single thing the puppy gets… and vice versa.But, for me and my family, it isn’t quite working out the way I hoped.It is a good product. I wish it would’ve worked out better for us. :-)"

B08KL4M5RK,Rosa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Addictive recipe, messy execution","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","The pup loves it, but it’s a logistical mess for humans.Pros:-picky dog likes the chicken recipe-great size and easy to hold for 17 week 6lb pup-the unchewed part is hard and doesn’t stain rugs-good 30min distraction for dogCons:-after the second ring, dog figured out how to break off a piece to eat super quickly. Now within the first five minutes he has broken the ring and goes from chewing to eating.-when the ring comes in contact with saliva it gets really really sticky. A mess for humans to pick up by hand-as a dog chews/eats it, little clumps get dislodged everywhere, radioactive yellow colored. Had to pick up.-it gets stuck in pups teeth once in smaller chunks, leading to dog running around the house trying to paw/dislodge by themselves. Needs human to actually dislodge."

B08KL4M5RK,Susan Lush,4.0 out of 5 stars,Puppy loves them—however I am watchful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2023",My little guy is just shy of 5lbs and a teething maniac— these calm him down and he works at them longer than any chew toy— however I lay with him and watch. Mostly at first because they say his size should only have half a one a day but as I watched him I noticed when was able to break thru an area he could get larger chunks off and I feelat his age those could be a chocking hazard.So I save them for when I have time to veg out with him for a bit—
B08KL4M5RK,Austin Happel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"6lb 16 week mini schnauzer - loves it, lasts ~3 days","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2023","We have a 16 week old mini schnauzer puppy who loves these things. Part of it is definitely that he can sink his teeth into it multiple times (kinda like a hard wax texture?), part of it is the shape due to how he tosses it, and another must be the flavor.  Thankfully it doesn't smell as bad as the bully stick nor the cod skins we have.  The cod skins do not offer the ""teeth sinking"" feeling this does, and while bully sticks do they stink so much.I would note that these rings do leave a sticky hard residue, likely from the rice flour or maybe the gelatin as it reminds me of how my hands feel after getting dried over cooked rice on clothing. His beard and paws feel crunchy afterwards and this can also end up on you, clothing, and furniture. We find this a very fair trade for the length of time this has entertained our landshark puppy though when compared to the smells of bully sticks and codskins (or the left over scales). Some hot water on a wash rag can clean it up easily without stains."
B08KL4M5RK,KJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Puppy loved these,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023",Gave the whole ring at first but recommended breaking them into twos. They last longer and the dog doesn’t need a whole ring unless you’re trying to distract her for a while.
B08KL4M5RK,Danny Nevitt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Puppy loves them!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2023",Definitely recommend for teething puppies! Our 3lb Morkie puppy loves them!

B08KL4M5RK,littleredjenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tiny puppy approved,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2022","My maltipoo pup loves these. I had ordered the tiny dog size when she first started teething, then mistakenly ordered the regular sized ones during Amazon's Pet Days event. Those are WAY too big for her. I made do by cutting those in half until we used them all up, but the tiny puppy ones are just the right size.When she was younger, a ring would keep her occupied for a good 30 mins or more. Now at eight months of age with all her permanent teeth either fully in or growing in, it takes her maybe 15 minutes to finish one off. Still a good busy-time treat while I'm on Zoom calls or as a reward for really good behavior, but I do wish they were a little bit longer lasting.These are also made in the U.S., which is important to me after so many imported pet treats have caused health issues. All in all, they're a bit pricey but worth it."

It keeps them busy for a while and keeps them from chewing other things that they shouldn't be chewing! When our puppy was about 3 months old, it would take him a few days to chew one. He is 5 months old now and he can eat one a day! My mom's boxer puppy loves these, too. Their older boxer tried one and demolished it within an hour. All dogs I know approve of this message!"
B08KL4M5RK,JLS-K,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for aggressive chewers,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2023","I bought these for my 3-month-old 4 lb yorkie puppy for teething purposes. What I didn't realize is that his sharp little baby teeth can chew this apart within minutes, leaving small pieces that are big enough to choke on.  I think I was expecting too much from this chew as my puppy is an aggressive chewer. Might be perfect for more ""chill"" puppies. I give my older yorkies all natural bully sticks (in a bully stick holder) and that's what I now use for my puppy."

B08KL4M5RK,Kimmer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Size for Small Puppy,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2023",A friend gave me several bags of the regular puppy size rings. I found myself holding them whilen she chewed and then throwing them away at the halfway point. We got both beef and pumpkin. She likes both.I found this smaller size being reviewed and ordered a bag. They’re a great size for her current size of 4-5 pounds.Do not leave your puppy unattended with these.  I would say that my puppy is an aggressive chewer. It takes her no time at all to chew through one of these.These could be a choke hazard if you’re not watching your puppy and discarding the ring once it’s down to a small nub.
B08KL4M5RK,Nickname,3.0 out of 5 stars,Puppy Hated Them,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023","My puppy, who will literally eat poop and garbage and bite every single inedible object in sight, hates this more than anything she's ever encountered.

B09R6FX8LH,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,My puppy loves these,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023","My 5 month old puppy loves these! I cut them in half and will give him it to chew on. It will keep him occupied for a good 20 minutes and every time he sees the bag he gets excited. There are only 9 sticks in the bag, but if you cut them in half like the bag recommends for a smaller weight dog, they will last longer. I have purchased this twice and would reorder again"

B09R6FX8LH,Christal,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t digest well,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023","I have a 6 month old goldendoodle that weights 25 lbs. He loves these treats but they make him throw up every time he eats one. I think he swallows too soon and doesn’t chew it down enough. Either way he will throw up chunks of it all night long. So I threw the rest away. I even tried holding it and letting him teeth on it that way but he was still trying to eat too large of pieces. They don’t even look like they have digested much at all when they come out. Even if its been 8 hrs since he ate it. But he loved the taste! So if your dog is good at chewing things up, I would recommend. If yours is like mine and likes to swallow big chunks, do not recommend."
B09R6FX8LH,Sarah Grunden,4.0 out of 5 stars,Don't last long but puppy loves them,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2022","Our golden retriever puppy loves these chew sticks.

It would be great at this price point if they lasted a bit longer, but he loves them and I love that they aren't as smelly as a lot of other chews we have tried. Overall I would recommend and will likely buy another pack."

The little dog grabs a piece and runs.Of course all the other pieces get eaten by my 12 year old dog.Since I don’t have the flexibility to give them smaller pieces, it gives the older dog much more of this treat at one time than I would prefer.Both of my dogs devour this in record time.  No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household. Or maybe if you had an older dog who did not want every single thing the puppy gets… and vice versa.But, for me and my family, it isn’t quite working out the way I hoped.It is a good product. I wish it would’ve worked out better for us. :-)"

B09FQBPCF1,Rosa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Addictive recipe, messy execution","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","The pup loves it, but it’s a logistical mess for humans.Pros:-picky dog likes the chicken recipe-great size and easy to hold for 17 week 6lb pup-the unchewed part is hard and doesn’t stain rugs-good 30min distraction for dogCons:-after the second ring, dog figured out how to break off a piece to eat super quickly. Now within the first five minutes he has broken the ring and goes from chewing to eating.-when the ring comes in contact with saliva it gets really really sticky. A mess for humans to pick up by hand-as a dog chews/eats it, little clumps get dislodged everywhere, radioactive yellow colored. Had to pick up.-it gets stuck in pups teeth once in smaller chunks, leading to dog running around the house trying to paw/dislodge by themselves. Needs human to actually dislodge."

B09FQBPCF1,Susan Lush,4.0 out of 5 stars,Puppy loves them—however I am watchful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2023",My little guy is just shy of 5lbs and a teething maniac— these calm him down and he works at them longer than any chew toy— however I lay with him and watch. Mostly at first because they say his size should only have half a one a day but as I watched him I noticed when was able to break thru an area he could get larger chunks off and I feelat his age those could be a chocking hazard.So I save them for when I have time to veg out with him for a bit—
B09FQBPCF1,Austin Happel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"6lb 16 week mini schnauzer - loves it, lasts ~3 days","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2023","We have a 16 week old mini schnauzer puppy who loves these things. Part of it is definitely that he can sink his teeth into it multiple times (kinda like a hard wax texture?), part of it is the shape due to how he tosses it, and another must be the flavor.  Thankfully it doesn't smell as bad as the bully stick nor the cod skins we have.  The cod skins do not offer the ""teeth sinking"" feeling this does, and while bully sticks do they stink so much.I would note that these rings do leave a sticky hard residue, likely from the rice flour or maybe the gelatin as it reminds me of how my hands feel after getting dried over cooked rice on clothing. His beard and paws feel crunchy afterwards and this can also end up on you, clothing, and furniture. We find this a very fair trade for the length of time this has entertained our landshark puppy though when compared to the smells of bully sticks and codskins (or the left over scales). Some hot water on a wash rag can clean it up easily without stains."
B09FQBPCF1,KJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Puppy loved these,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023",Gave the whole ring at first but recommended breaking them into twos. They last longer and the dog doesn’t need a whole ring unless you’re trying to distract her for a while.

B09FQBPCF1,littleredjenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tiny puppy approved,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2022","My maltipoo pup loves these. I had ordered the tiny dog size when she first started teething, then mistakenly ordered the regular sized ones during Amazon's Pet Days event. Those are WAY too big for her. I made do by cutting those in half until we used them all up, but the tiny puppy ones are just the right size.When she was younger, a ring would keep her occupied for a good 30 mins or more. Now at eight months of age with all her permanent teeth either fully in or growing in, it takes her maybe 15 minutes to finish one off. Still a good busy-time treat while I'm on Zoom calls or as a reward for really good behavior, but I do wish they were a little bit longer lasting.These are also made in the U.S., which is important to me after so many imported pet treats have caused health issues. All in all, they're a bit pricey but worth it."

B00061MULK,Hana Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,My cat is addicted to these,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2020","I have two cats. One of them played with these sticks for a little while but didn't seem to figure out they were chewable, even when I stuck them in his mouth. Oh well, he's a little dumb anyway.The other cat LOVES them. She needs her stick fix every day. She gets one at 6pm and the other around midnight, and she knows it - when the time comes she'll go to the kitchen counter and start meowing and begging for them. Sometimes she plays fetch with the stick, but most of the time we throw it for her, she runs after it, grabs it and starts chowing down. She even figured out how to stick one end into the high pile carpet so that she can keep it stable while she gnaws on the other end. They seem to be doing a good job of keeping my girl cat's teeth clean; we have to give dental treats and water additives for the other cat. We've been subscribed to these sticks for over a year now and she goes through about three packs a month.So your mileage may vary with these sticks. From my sample size of 2, there's a 50% chance of stick addiction and 50% chance that they'll totally flop. Even so, I have to give them 5 stars because of how much my girl loves them. If they ever discontinue these, I'm going to have a very unhappy cat on my hands.Oh, and the first few times you give these to your cat, keep a close eye on them. My cat has never choked in her 1 year plus of eating these every day, but she has taken bites that were too large and immediately vomited them up after - I guess the large chunks didn't sit well in her stomach. If you have a very small kitten, they may choke."

Within 5 hours of eating a small piece I cut off (it’s so hard I used kitchen scissors) we were at the emergency vet. My cat was throwing up, wouldn’t drink water and had diarrhea for days.

B00061MULK,Critter,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have a cat who loves to chew but..,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2023","So my cat loves to chew on pens or anything in the shape, sp I thought these would be more appropriate for him. He chew through 2 sticks but the 3rd time I tried to give him one he turned away from it. I gave one to the dog to show him they're the same thing but time after time he still turned away from it.I do know cats don't normally find ""chew"" toys necessary since cats don't typically chew in the same way dogs do. So perhaps this bone broth stick is just too hard for cats in general. But i think tbr taste is fine bc other animals in the house see it as a treat. in the end I turned to just finding some some what mildly freezed dried meat treats for his chewy-like behavior.Dogs however love the bone broth stick. I gave the rest of the bag to a toy poodle owner and her 2 dogs loved them. So 3 stars for decent dog treats that has the word cat on the bag. I don't think it's a bad treat, just not for cats."

B00061MULK,Jennifer W.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Life saver,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2022","When I first bought these my cat really wasn’t that interested, but she warmed up to these. This has been a lifesaver for me because my cat has a G.I. issue and I have realize that when she starts trying to chew everything in my home office while I’m working, that it’s because her tummy is aggravating her. I now leave the sticks in my desk and when she starts chewing on my artificial plants and papers and pens, I offer her a stick and she now comes running. The downside is that she can’t hold it on her own without me holding it. However, it absolutely does the trick  and stops her from Destroying my house and eating something that she is not supposed to eat. She’s also fine with just less than one stick per day.It’s surprisingly sit well on her stomach as well and that makes me happy, because there’s not a lot of treats out there that she can have with a diet that she’s on. I don’t think of these like a cat treat, but more of a chew therapy for a cat that needs to chew on some thing. Hope this helps people in similar situations. Best advice, offer it to your cat when you see them chewing because they are more likely to try it and once they try it they may like it more. Again I would not offer this as just an occasional every day treat, as there are probably better ones out there if your cat does not have stomach issues."

These are very tough and hard to chew through and it takes him a good minute or two to do so. Would definitely not recommend for any cats with bad teeth, they won't be able to eat them. None of my other four cats like them, they won't even lick them. But for Ollie it seems to sate his chewing urge for a while really well.

B00061MULK,C. Jackson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023","My cat is a unrepentant chewer. He chews on everything he can get his mouth around. We haven't found much that will discourage it. These have been a welcome addition to the house. We've been sticking them near things that he likes to chew on, and evidently they're a bit more enticing because he's been leaving the other stuff around the house alone. He seems to really enjoy biting bits off so there are little pea-sized nodules peppered around the area but he's no longer putting himself at risk by chewing on electrical cords so I consider this an absolute success. Plus it seems that it's fun to play with because even the ones he's knocked loose from the places we've wedged them he'll roll around on and kick. Definitely recommend for chewers."

After reading the reviews, I really wondered if my cat would actually use them but to my surprise, he LOVES them!  He tosses it into the air like a toy, paws and pushes it across the floor and, yes, he actually does chew on them.

B00061MULK,winter flodman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mr. Biggles approved!! :-),"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2015","I ordered these two weeks ago. They finally arrived. They were a hit with Mr. Biggles. He is a 13 week main coon/bengal tabby mix, and he still hasn't mastered how to chew on the stick but he loves the flavor and is definitely interested in them. The stick themselves ARE soft enough for a cat to break the stick down with bites and chunks. If you do own a cat that is a chewer, then you may want watch them, just so they don't choke. I'm glad that it is easy for the cat to chew but not too soft that Mr. Biggles looses interests or eats them and moves on. Considering that there are enough chew bones in a 3.37 oz package, being that they are 4"" sticks each, I feel that they will last several month. Mr. Biggles is teething, but that much of a chewer. Being that these are all natural and made in the USA, this makes the product an even more handsome buy. ***Edit Review**** My. Mr. Biggles eats the stick in 4 minutes or less. He mastered this by 7 months old. They are his 2nd favorite to chew on, 1st is bison lung. He has clean teeth and no bad breath. I moved on to bully and raw hide, it lasts longer."

B00061MULK,Jonquil M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cats LOVE these! Great for teething,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","My cats LOVED these as soon as they smelled them! Fantastic idea for teething kittens. My kitten won't use any teething toys, but he loves these!I don't really understand how someone can complain about there being more wheat and corn than chicken in this. They are supposed to be hard to wear down. I can't see this being possible with chicken being the primary ingredient. The formulation is perfectly right for what the product actually IS. Your cat isn't going to sit there and eat the entire thing in one sitting, so I'm pretty sure a little more wheat and corn than chicken isn't going to kill them.If you don't like the idea of your cats chewing on anything that isn't pure meat, you're not going to find anything like this usable. If your cat is allergic, you already know they are because you'll have to purchase special food for them, as well. N.y cats eat natural food, where meat is the primary ingredient, and there's still some veggies and grains in there, because in general they are GOOD for them and make up part of a well balanced diet.If your cat has allergies, though, you'll be happy to know there are catnip sticks on Amazon, too, which are literally sticks that have been broken off from the plant. Problem solved.This product though doesn't deserve the bashing another reviewer here gave it. My cats love it, they love their food too for that matter (they were the ones that picked it), and they're healthy. That's all I can really ask for."

My cat is a biter and LOVES to chew on a good (iPhone) cord or paper. I tried buying him a chicken flavored plastic dog bone, but I think it was too big for him to put around his mouth and actually chew on. The first time I tried to give this to my cat, Stan, he didn't really know what to do with it. He licked it a little bit and was just over it. I thought it was a failure. Then one day, he was play biting at me on the couch and I put the bone in place of my finger and he started chewing it. It took a LONG time of me holing the bone/treat while he chewed away for him to finish the first one, I was also a little concerned when it got broken down into a smaller size that it could be a choking hazard, but it's been fine. He just started his second treat and this time he knew what he was doing and at half of it in one sitting. I think it was a successful purchase for me, but I'm sure it's totally dependent on the cat."

I have 3 cats and it's like none of them understand the concept of this stick type treat.  If your cats are the type to eat jerky, maybe they would be right for those type cats.  Think mine may just be lazy, cause our dogs love them.  Too expensive to buy for dogs though.. I gave them 4 stars because I don't think anything is wrong with them.  Just maybe wrong animal.  I bought because I felt the concept is good.  Cats get bored with just treat pieces sometimes.  I think if these had a stronger smell and were less bound by a waxy covering my cats would like them better.  Too hard for most cats I feel because cats are pretty lazy and get bored working for food too much.  If I had one cat I would be more guarded with my review of these, but all three cats do the same.. But if you also have a dog they won't be wasted..."

These are 100% a treat that needs to be supervised, but I loved that it was a challenge for them to chew through and that they had to put some effort in. It’s not rock hard like I’ve seen other reviews say, it can bend and be broken with some effort, but definitely isn’t some thing they can chew through in just a couple bites. All of the ones who took it ate them in a single sitting so it’s not too difficult that they will give up. Happy I found something for my chewers! Hopefully this will be a fix to that problem!"
B00061MULK,Iris,3.0 out of 5 stars,My cat is not enticed,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2013","Well, the good news is that I can give these to my cat when she starts to chew the pens and pencils in my pencil cup on my desk. The bad news is that she only chews these if I literally stick them in her mouth. She doesn't seem to care for the flavor (if there is any), and if I'm not actively giving it to her, she's only interested in it as a toy to knock off the desk. It's been a few months, and she's really only gnawed a bit at the end of one stick. The only saving grace for this product is that I feel safer using it as a chewing distraction (I can't imagine that the metal/plastic of pens and pencils is any good for her if it breaks off in her mouth). Sadly, I'm not really sure why dogs have a plethora of enticing chewing options but cats only have little dental treats."

Sometimes I have to play with him a bit to get him to eat them. That is the only reason they are four stars instead of five. However, they work as advertised as dental treats. My little guy had tartar issues that led to bad breath and having two of his teeth pulled (not the fangs, thank goodness). Talked to the vet about how to improve, and she suggested chew treats. I had already tried Greenies, but my greedy cat gobbled them whole without chewing them. Definitely needed something in stick form that he would have to pull apart. Stumbled across these on Amazon and they work great. No more bad breath, and more importantly, no more dental issues. He gets a clean bill every checkup! He is actually scheduled to have his teeth cleaned once a year, but the vet recommended skipping the last time because his teeth were in such great shape. Worth the effort to get him to eat one every day!"

Pickier animals may not be as enthused. I got this hoping it would be a toy he could eat afterwards and that he would be less excited about chewing other things, and it achieved the first but not the second.It doesn't smell, which I count as a plus, but it clearly tastes like something since he eats it. It loses a star because it's not very hard for him to chew off huge chunks and swallow them, and I'm not sure it's good for him to eat a lot of it."

Particularly cords. So I was actually excited when I found a treat with a lot of complaints that cats found it too difficult to eat. Finally, something he can’t scarf down in mere seconds! So I gave him his first treat and timed how long it took him to eat it. One minute and fifty-six seconds. He was a super determined and single-minded about it, and he is a large cat so I am sure that made it easier for him. It didn’t take him nearly as long as I had hoped, but it kept him occupied longer than anything else I have found, and let him take out some of his need to chew on something he is actually allowed to chew. So overall a win!He is almost 12 years old so age doesn’t seem to be an issue in his case.If your cat isn’t very food-driven or doesn’t love to chew, this is probably not an appropriate treat for them."

They both looked at them and kicked them around.  That was it.  They didn't even try to chew them so there must not have been a smell to them.  I was very disappointed that these didn't work out.
B00061MULK,Kiiyo,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not made of meat..?,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2013","My cat is a 1 year old Turkish Van who is a big chewer. He has a problem with eating things he's not supposed to and I was looking for something to help relieve his chewing on bad things. I always hated how they didn't have any good chew things for cats because I can attest that chew cats exist! Well my cat didn't want anything to do with these chews... The packaging makes it look like it's a meaty chew, but its actually a firm clear-ish gelatinous stick, I'm assuming its a juice or or artificial flavoring? I won't be buying these again, but I'm glad this is on the market because I'm sure some cats would love it, just not mine. It's well packaged and is resealable. I'd like to suggest an alternative that I found that my cat actually likes. It's Dogswell Happy Hips Salmon or Chicken Jerky. They're made for dogs but they're just dehydrated meat with no hormones or additives so it's good for cats too, and your cat may like it if it doesn't like these because it's actually meat!"
B00061MULK,IrisAura,4.0 out of 5 stars,most don't like these sticks,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2015","I can't give the sticks 5 stars because out of my pride of cats, most don't like these sticks. However, when you have 2 who like to play fetch, and gnaw on things because they're young and full of energy and like to chew on things they shouldn't, they love these. I will add though, that they do like Sentry Petrodex VS Dental Twist Treats better, but I want to make sure there's something for them to chew and give them options. The other cats besides these two, just stare at the sticks and walk away after sniffing them. Putting it into their food dish isn't even a good hint. So, your cat will either really love them or really hate them. It only takes one bag to find out."
B00061MULK,Harlequin Rose,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard chewing kitten loves the flavor but too tough for him to eat,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2019","We have an 8 month old kitten who is a chewing fiend. The tender meaty stick treats might last all of 90 seconds with him. These treats sounded like something that he could really work on and satisfy his chewing urges thereby saving our shoestrings, hoodie pulls and cords. He carried the stick around all over the house, put it in a shoe and licked then gnawed on it for about 10 minutes before giving up and leaving it sticky and melding into the carpet."
B00061MULK,Aryn,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not even neighborhood animals would touch it,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2020","I was trying various ""stick"" type treats for my cat since those are his favorite; he loves chewing, and I was hoping to find some that gave him a little more to chew on and not be scarfed down. Well, these are not it, because he didn't even register that it was food. He sniffed it, and then rubbed his face on it and walked off.Ok, I certainly don't blame a product for my cat not liking it; cats can have different taste just like people. As I do with many treats my cat doesn't care for, I tried giving it to my neighbor's outdoor cat who visits daily (needless to say, for treats). She was completely uninterested. I laid it on the doormat thinking she might go for it eventually, and I had to go back to work and forgot about it. Over the next couple hours, not one but two of my neighbor's dogs came by (up to my door, where they stare intently at my cat through the screen). The NEXT DAY, after which who knows what else (including y'know, bugs and other wildlife) could have eaten the blasted thing, there it was, whole, on my door mat.I'm not positive what is in this, but whatever it is, it must be really, really unappetizing."

They don’t leave any kind of smell on my fingers after picking it up either.For only a few dollars you get so many of these in a bag too, such a good deal!(Sorry, I know the picture is very blurry but that’s him carrying it in his mouth)"
B00061MULK,Cady L,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cat just batted it around,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2022","Got these for our adolescent cat who seems to chew on most things, but these she just batted around like a stick. She'd pick them up in her mouth but they didn't seem to register as food unless I gave her a very, very small chunk, which is extremely hard to do. I recently bought a brand name version of a ""chicken stick"" and she went absolutely crazy for it and gobbled it right up. The texture was noticeably better as well.So if you want a hard stick your cat can throw around this will fit that bill, but otherwise it just wasn't worth it."

My cat will bite just about anything though. My main problem with these is that my cat easily ate them in just a few seconds. Although it doesn't specifically say that they are particularly hard, I inferred it from the fact that they're ""chew treats"". I thought it was the type of thing the cat could gnaw on for some time, which I was hoping would help channel at least a bit of my cats oral fixation on something better than my flesh or furniture. These are just basically long stick shaped regular treats though."

She was meh about them except when I was shoving them in her mouth to save my fingers from sharp little teeth. Got them 5 years ago with the same results for my sister's kitten I was watching while she was deployed. They held more interest when fresh and soft... Once opened and out of the package, they hardened and had to be tossed in a few days.Got 2 kittens this past week, and again--in need of something to shove in their mouth when they go after my fingers. They are a hit with these babies!I feed high quality pet food and treats, and while the ingredients in this don't fit my normal standards, I want something for a few months that they can gnaw on and won't cause blockages if ingested. The majority of toys for kittens are either too soft for teething or hazardous when viciously chewed.  This is a perfect compromise--won't harm teething kittens."

We specifically got these because our male is a very heavy chewer. At this point we often refer to him as 'the dog', despite not owning any dogs. He chews that much. On everything ( and I mean everything.) But he ignores these. He sniffed them once, licked a few times, bit once, and then spat it out. The other cat barely even looked at them.

Unfortunately, he eats those and there are all sorts of smells in his litterbox so I needed to make sure he couldn't get to them. I found these to replace those chewies to help me out and he loves them. He plays fetch with them for a while and then just sits down and chews on them. My only con to this product is that he goes through them too quickly-- I wish they were a little longer lasting like one of those ""digestible"" rawhide-like products for dogs."

When I received the treats I was immediately skeptical. They look like brown glue sticks that go into a glue gun. My cat was less than interested in the treat. I inspected a bit and they have no smell at all so I'm confused how these would attract an animal if they don't even seem appetizing. I'm still going to try to entice my cat to try them and I'm sure they can work well for others. I just don't have a lot of hope for my cat.

He is pretty picky when it comes to things that require chewing, but he loves these.  He seems to like all Twistix flavors equally.  I like the ingredients.  It's nice that there's nothing in them to bother my dog's stomach.  I have no idea if they actually clean teeth or not, but they do seem to help with his breath at least temporarily. If they do clean teeth that is a bonus, but I would get these anyway because they're good chews. They are easy enough that my dog doesn't give up or lose interest, but hard enough that he doesn't finish them in seconds."

I was worried about these treats when I first took them out of the bag because they're hard like chalk and my dog is 13 years old. She didn't like them right away but after she started to spend some time on them, they started to dissolve and she could chew on them more easily. These treats are great for distracting dogs but you also have to be careful if they're a smaller dog because the treat is really hard and I could see it could cause choking in over ambitious dogs that don't take the time to break down the treat. The only flaw in these treats is that my dog has a beard and these treats get really milky and foamy and once she finishes her treat it looks like she has rabies and that she's foaming at the mouth. I always find chunks of unfinished twistix dental chews melted to her beard with foam. She loves them so much and they're good for her teeth so I can't complain. I just have to clean her up every time after she's had one of these treats."

It appears I might have been too hasty in blaming the vomiting mentioned in my original review on the Twistix.  I waited a couple weeks and gave it another try.  She's been eating them all week (one at bed time) without any issues.  I prefer the smell (and her breath) after eating the vanilla mint, but as far as the dog is concerned, she eats both flavors with equal enthusiasm.Original Review...............My dog loves Twistix but twice now, she's thrown up a couple hours after having one at bed time.  We normally give her the vanilla mint version which she's eaten for over a year without any issues.  For some reason, the yogurt banana version doesn't agree with her system.  She weighs 50 lbs and gets only small one at bedtime, so I'm not sure what this issue is with this flavor.  We aren't doing anything differently other than having switched flavors."

My small dog has been eating the larger vanilla twistex for 8 years. The larger longer ones work fine. A few weeks ago he got the smaller one stuck in his throat.

B003AYCVVY,ZulaMaeRules,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cinnamon Chewy Goodness for Canine Teeth,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2014","Living with a four dog pack as I do, daily brushing can become routine and cumbersome (I do it in the pm with Virbac Vanilla Mint enzymatic toothpaste which they love and which actually contributes to teeth health whether you brush or just swipe it through on a swab - enzymatic, so if you are introducing the idea or have a non cooperative dog it might be a good thing to check out as well for those reasons) so I look for fun ways to add to the process of canine teeth cleaning. I read an article somewhere about this product that made me look into it further. Note here, I am all about natural raw feeding, integrative vet care, wholesome ingredients and positive training and keeping up with new ideas like Reiki for animals. (It really works!).I bought the small chews for my standard size dogs (50 - 70 pounds) because I don't give large treats but prefer to parcel them out. Perfect size. After their breakfast they each get a chew stick and they love them. I feed them in their crates and the floor gets a bit slimy because they break off bits and shove them around but with crate feeding (the rare times the dogs use the crates anymore) the floors get cleaned up anyway. You can smell the cinnamon which I know is good for breath and other ailments in humans as well. One of my concerns with these dental type chews in the past has been the possibility of blockages and these appear to not pose that risk to my dogs, being narrow and chewy and not overly hard with ridges, kind of like a star shaped stick. I only give one a day per dog in the morning because I don't want to upset tummies and I want to keep these a special treat even though these treats have a job. I broke one into fourths and gave them to a friend with a Shi Tzu and suggested one piece per day for him since he is tiny. He loved them. So a little goes a long way. Between the Naked Chew in the morning and the Virbac Enzymatic toothpaste in the evening my dogs teeth are really improving and they are all seniors who had some residue I was looking to improve upon. Teeth are looking shiny white like me after a trip to my favorite dental hygienist. I recommend the combination. The raw diet does contribute of course. These are a safer, healthier dental chew than anything else I've seen with ingredients I am comfortable with offering my dogs in reasonable portions. I recommend supervising your dog at first and considering the size of your dog and the size of the treat and perhaps breaking the treat into smaller portions if you have a smaller dog and offering that either two a day or depending on the sensitivity of your dog's digestion. I order in quantity to reduce cost. I think this is a great product."

She loved that flavor and I have been buying that flavor for her for a few months now.The ingredients in this treat are very healthy and I noticed her bowel movement are regular.

B003AYCVVY,Zack J.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for dogs with a sensitive stomach,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2013","I have two small terriers that both enjoy these chew sticks. I've had trouble finding a chew stick that doesn't make one of my dogs vomit. Both dogs seem to enjoy these and I have not noticed any signs of an upset stomach. The chews are a good size for my 15ish pound dogs. Both are strong chewers, so the sticks are gone in less than a minute. They have a pleasant, spicy scent like nutmeg or cinnamon. One of my dogs has always had stinky breath, and these seem to freshen his breath, but I have not used these for long enough to say if they improve his dental health.The subscribe and save option is nice, as I have only seen these in one local pet ""boutique"" with a much higher price."

I have not noticed a difference in his digestion, but he seems to like the taste. I like that the ingredients seem simple and healthy, but next time, I might look for something that will last longer than 2 minutes."
B003AYCVVY,Kaila,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for sensitive stomach!!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2016","I tried these for my rescue pup that has a very sensitive stomach and digestive issues and I'm so glad I did! He's very picky so I was a little nervous to try them, but I decided to anyway. He LOVES them! He gets so excited and runs around like it's a new bone to chew on. He is about 55 pounds and does go through one rather quickly. But he hasn't had an issue at all with them affecting his stomach (which is AMAZING!) I was skeptical at first since a lot of dog products now say things about helping with digestion. I'm not sure if these actually help with digestion, but seeine as they don't make my pup with a sensitive stomach throw up, they're an A+ in my book! I do wish they made these in bigger sizes. It would last longer for my pup. They do smell a bit odd (they have a slight minty scent) and I was worried about my picky dog not liking that, but he's not affected by it at all."
B003AYCVVY,CS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Contains carrageen,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2014","* Updated October 2014 *. I used to love these treats for my dog until I realized they contain carrageen. With all the sever health issues reported from carrageenan ingestion in humans, you'd think that pet companies like this would remove it from their ingredients and replace it with another safer choice.  Until the company removes this ingredient, I cannot recommend.  It's a shame because these are great dental chews that are not hard on the teeth and my dog loves them."
B003AYCVVY,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Dog Approved but Do Not Stay Fresh that Long,"Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2016",My dog seems to enjoy these treats. The are a good length and my dog runs around the house with them in his mouth. The only thing I will mention is that we've had these now a relatively short time and my bag seems to have gone stale a bit. I sometimes half them and have noticed they are considerably more difficult to do so with my hands after only a couple of weeks. I alternate these with many different variety of dog treats so it would be nice if they stayed fresher longer. I never noticed any difference in my dog's bowel movements since incorporating them into his treat rotation so this is a plus.

I have been buying these for over a year and they were selling between 3.99 - 5.81 as add on item. Most of the time the cost was under 5 USD. All of  a sudden the cost increased over 100 percent in just a few weeks! My dog loves them and will sit and beg at 3 pm until he gets one every day but now we won't be able to afford them for this new price. It will be heartbreaking to look at his sad face waiting for his favorite treat and not getting any. Really hope this is just temporary. Taking star off because of this.

They all look and smell the same so I’m not convinced they are actually different but whatever. They are good for his teeth. I have an 18 lb shih-tzu mix and it takes him only minutes to eat one. Can’t speak to whether they actually help with his digestion but I can say he does not have digestion issues from them. So that’s a plus. They are easily digestible.

I think working harder on chewing should help keep her teeth cleaner.They are more expensive and come only 6 to a pack. So she gets one a week and the Dentastix the rest of the days. I have them on once a month Subscribe and Save. The 15% discount there is a nice assist with my tight budget!"
B003AYCVVY,Packrat Tendencies,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shih Tzu recommended,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2015","My 4 year old Shih Tzu is super picky about what he will/won't eat and has stomach problems. I bought this in hopes he'd at least try it, and he's gone through the whole bag, one a day. I don't think he has thrown up since we changed to these from Dentastix, everything else in his diet staying the same...... The vets don't seem to think his upset stomach is a big deal, but they've never seen him when he's in the middle of an episode. It's more like a seizure. I've got him off wheat now. With all his other issues, the dental cleaning is just an added bonus. I would recommend these and wish they'd get them in bulk on Subscribe & Save."

I keep looking for the cheaper models of this absolute favorite of my little guy's world. He practically screams when I say ""it's chew time."" He gets a half of one every night like clockwork, and because of this he always seems to know what time it is really. The other problem besides price would be that they disappear in a flash. I keep them in the fridge so they'll at least be a little harder to wolf down. Can you please make them last longer and then I won't mind the price as much. Pretty soon I'm afraid we're not going to be able to afford these awesome gold nuggets of a treat."

The fact is you would never know because there was no nutrition information on the package.....my vet told me and she told me me dogs were obese.  The ""Get Naked"" treats clearly list the caloric information, and if you reward one chew treat a day, it isn't a huge addition of calories for your pet.They can be a bit pricey and I do shop around to find the best prices.....Oh, and my dogs love them too~"

This is going to be her daily dental treat from now on. :) I wish I could give more than 5 starsUpdate:She now treats them like her morning coffee.

They love all the Get Naked dental chews equally, so I get a variety.  They wait for me every morning in excited anticipation by the basket where the treats are, since they get one every morning before I leave for work.  One of them has a very sensitive stomach, and these treats have never bothered her tummy.  Their teeth look pretty good too - just had a vet visit.  I thought my 8 year old dog's teeth would be worse, and they were in pretty good shape, so it looks like the dental chews are helping."

She ran up to it and sniffed it and would jump back repeating this process several times.  Then she would cautiously approach it and paw at it.  She eventually ate it.  My dog loves these now and gobbles it right up.
B003AYCVVY,Stephanie R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my Shih Tzus,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2016",My shih tzu mixes are obsessed with these things. The bigger one can eat one of these in about 5 minutes while the smaller one takes about 30 minutes to chew on it. All in all I feel great giving them a chew that makes me feel like I am giving them something healthy. Another bonus is when they have snuck up on the couch to chew on them I haven't seen any gross residue that you can get with other similar products. Will be buying again!

But I must say I can actually see a difference since he's been eating these, and he does seem to like them. His stomach has always been a little finicky with some foods, but he has no problem keeping these down. These chews also help a lot with bad breath. I definitely recommend."

This product seemed perfect, at least in theory - what's better for her gut health than a product literally called ""Gut Health Dental Chew""?Well, whatever the name claims, whenever she has one of these treats she almost immediately has diarrhea. As those with dogs can attest to, it's difficult to accurately link what a dog eats with how it affects their bowels, but we saw it happen enough to not be a coincidence.She does love them, though. At least, until she has to wipe her butt on the ground."

They are excellent on their own or meal toppers. They are very soft so easy on his super senior teeth (or lack thereof lol), sometimes we crumble them on top of his wet or dry food to get him more excited to eat. They also have seemed to help keep his #2 movements nice and even as he had been having some gastric issues and inconsistencies. One thing to note is bc of their hairball remedy ingredients you are only supposed to give them a few a day (for his 9 lbs weight it’s 3x day). I wish I could give him more to stack his calories!!"

He first got them from Santa in his stocking for Xmas, and he loved them so much I've continued to buy them. We've tried MANY cat treats over our 16 years together (well, I've bought them and he tried them), and he's never loved any like he loves these! He is a longhaired cat and, as a bonus, they have really reduced the amount of hairballs he gets quite substantially, so it's a win/win. Now he will actually meow and ""ask"" for a treat whenever a family member goes to where we keep them, and my daughter has even taught him the ""trick"" of standing on his hind legs and reaching up to ""tap the bag"" with his paw as she holds it in order to ""earn"" a treat. lol"

I got these treats because she has a hard time going to the bathroom & these are for digestive health...they HAVE not helped at all & like I said its been over a year. But yes I continued to buy these treats,not because they helped but because she loves them so much,or did...lately I've noticed the treats are different. They have always been a little moist. Lately they are more moist then they have ever been.i was scared to feed them to her because they looked darker in color & very vey moist!!! I reached out to Amazon, they just gave me a credit gift card. So I tried again thinking maybe I just got a bad bag. Nope same thing. I didn't reach out to Amazon. Waited a week or two. My cat loves these and I was upset! So I figured I'll try one more time to buy these treats. We'll same thing! And my cat is not crazy about these so I know something isn't right!!! I called Amazon told them the issue, they can see from my account how many times I've purchased these treats! It was ALOT!! I told him something needs to be done about this. He gave me my money back on my card and said he was going to bring it up to the  company that makes these..I don't know if it going to change anything but I can say they lost me as a costumer buying these!!! I won't waste my $ on these to go in the trash! They don't even help my cat go to the bathroom!!!!"

The first pack was perfect but the second and third pack had half of them crushed apart. Since he likes them and they work for him I'll just feed him the crumbs. But some better quality control would be nice.Update: I've been ordering these for a while and it seems like they've taken notice of the texture / crumbling problem and the last 2 bags have been a lot better!

She immediately went for the treat and when offered her a pinch of the crumbs (see below)  she licked it right up out of my hand and asked for more.Zero stars for Amazon’s shipping. I also purchased a six-lb bag of cat food; they came together in one large box. Predictably, the cat treat package appeared as if it had been repeatedly smashed or stomped on. About 1/4 of the treats remain whole. The rest are big crumbs or just cat treat dust (sandy texture). Amazon did provide me with a refund at my request.I will sprinkle the crumbs in with her kibble or on top of her wet topper so it doesn’t go to waste.  Will update my review to evaluate products claims if I see any improvement or change in her health."

They appear to have cut down the number of hairballs that happened  daily to once or twice a week.  I appreciate that.  It is a 5 star product for the hairball relief.I don't like that now the chews are almost turning in to dust right in the bag.  That won't help with the amount you're supposed to give.

I wanted to find something to help with his hairballs and thought a treat would be good. But sometimes he just turns his nose up at them and leaves them to sit. I assume the flavor may just not be to my cats preference? I have other treats that he will eat no matter what or when so maybe he realizes it's supposed to help him haha. They're a soft treat and smell alright. He has had less hairballs since I started giving him these so I think it works pretty good. The price is great for how many you get so it's worth giving to your kitty if they do get a lot of hairballs. Sometimes I add them into his daily wet food to get him to eat them when he turns his nose up.

I have one cat who would throw up now and then and also a hairball occasionally.  All five cats like the treats.  One long-haired female was always sleeping.  She is definitely more energetic after just a week eating these treats.  Two cats could stand to gain some weight,hoping this will help aide in digestion.  I have noticed their stools seem to have hair in them that I never noticed before.  Maybe more fur is now being passed in the stools so not necessary to throw up fur balls?  I will keep buying this product, certainly can’t harm them.  Long haired cats get 2/day and the shorter haired cats get one/day for now.  If they continue to tolerate I will give according to weight as suggested.  All kitties are two years old."

My one kitten is an avid groomer, she started trying to cough up hairballs a few days a week.  I've been feeding this to her for a few weeks, she has not had a problem since.  My other kitten wasn't a fan of the treats as much, but then she started having the same problem.  I started giving one treat at a time to her during different times of the day.  Now she will eat all 3 at once.  The treats look soft, but they are a little hard.  My kittens have a hard time chewing the first treat I give them, they will drop it a few times.  The second and third treat they have no problems with oddly.  I also like the more natural ingredients along with the probiotics.  I will keep giving this to them as long as they like it."

Our cats don't care for them as much as the previous versions, and they make a mess. What happened? I hope it was a one time issue.

No sensitive tummy issues at all, and these are their absolute favorite cat treats of all time! Their eyes get wide and light up every time I get them out! No more constipation and little rabbit pellets in the litter box. These cats are pooping like heavy-weight champs! And racing around like crazy cats instead of acting their age. Thank you!Suggestion:  Please make a multi-pack of several of these packets in a box, maybe 12, 16, or 20. It will keep them secure with less crumbling and make them easier to buy and store.

After using these treats for a few weeks the kitten has solid poops almost all the time. The 2 year old has large solid poops instead of the small pellets. I recommend putting these on a plate with a few treats your cat really likes to sort of trick them into eating them at first. Once they get used to them they should eat them no problem."

That's how much she likes them.Now, whether they help her with hairballs?  That I can't say.  She really never had much of a hairball problem to start with.  We actually bought these for her much-longer-furred younger sister Zenda, who is a serious hairball depositor, but Zenda is kind of ""meh"" about the Get Naked furball treats and much prefers the Feline Greenies.  But that's just fine by Amarillo, who is fine with not having to share.  In fact, she can't get enough of them.

It's still too early to tell if these will help with the hairballs but so far it's been good.The only downside is that she should only get 3 treats per day based on her body weight.

B01HUX3NNU,V R,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kitty likes it and it works with the vomitting,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2023","My cat had been vomiting a lot after we moved. I wasn't sure if it had to do with hairballs or stress. Either way, this product worked. The vomiting has reduced greatly, happening maybe once in a couple of month now. He loves the flavor and if I forget to give it, he will bug me until I do."
B01HUX3NNU,Pattie,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 out of 3 love them,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2018","I have 1 adult cat that I bought these for because he's on prescription diet for urinary issues. He's the least finicky of my 3 cats but he won't touch these. He loves the Get Naked Urinary treats. Maybe it's the difference in texture. These treats are rather large but are soft & chewy/crumbly. I've tried breaking them up & mixing with his dry food & the bits get left in the bottom of the bowl. My other 2 cats (including the queen of finicky) gobble them down so it's not a total loss. The one that won't eat them is a shorthair but he has a heavy undercoat & also grooms his longhaired sister so I know he'll have hairball issues at some point. I guess I'll have to try something else for him. As for the others that will eat the treats, no sign of hairball issues since I started feeding these so I'm good with that. I like the fact that they are natural."

She will eat them, but only after she has finished the rest of the food in her bowl. I have noticed that she has furballs less often now that I am giving her these treats (once every 5 weeks or so compared to once every couple of weeks), which is great because she has long hair and is prone to furballs. I would recommend these despite them not being the tastiest kitty treats!"

B01HUX3NNU,Christopher J. Wells,5.0 out of 5 stars,Used for years,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2022",My cat loves these.  She gets hairballs very easily.

B01HUX3NNU,Angel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ragdoll hates it,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2020","This was actually very cheap, and I liked that the treats were thick but soft enough to chew. I had to break the treats into half because they were just unusually big for my 8-lb Ragdoll. Unfortunately, she hates chicken flavor, so I could only give her 2 treats a day for 2 days max. The second day she threw up because she just didn't like it and I couldn't manage to give it to her the third day. I wish there was a fish or beef flavor of this digestive health treats since those are her favorite flavors. The scent was really strong too, so if your cat hates chicken flavor as well, they're definitely not going to eat this. I suggest giving like 2 treats in their food bowl and burying the scent with wet cat food."

I give my outdoor 8 lb, 13 year old cat 3 treats every morning when I drink my coffee and even though she hasn't been outside for a month (snowy in maine) she has had no coughing and regular bowel movements all winter- a good substitute for eating grass, I'd say.

I was looking for a treat that was on the softer side for a kitty with sensitive teeth. while they are indeed soft they were voted as gross by our felines. Of the three cats in the house, only one would even consider eating these treats, one tried to burry them like something foul that had escaped from his litter box and the last one ran away whenever the treats were offered. I don't know if it was a bad batch or what, but these are not the treats for us."

My cat just did not seem to like them. She ate 2 of them when I first received them, and then turned her nose up at them every other single time I tried to give them to her. They are not as soft as I thought they would be either. They are somewhat soft, but not to my cats liking I guess. They state that they are soft and healthy, which was my reason for purchasing. Unless I happened to get hold of a bad batch or something. Your kitty or cat may like them, but mine doesn’t. All cats are different."

B0CJZ69YMK,Accessory Shop Plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,tail waggin good,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","Yo, fellow dog lovers! Just tossed my furry buddy one of these Dental Sticks, grain-free and chicken-flavored, from a 6.6-oz bag made for seniors, and let me tell you – it was an instant hit. This isn't just a treat; it's like a party for their taste buds and a high-five to their dental health.Firstly, the chicken flavor is legit. It's like these sticks have been seasoned with some kind of dog-approved magic. My old boy went for it like it was the best thing since belly rubs.The grain-free part is cool, especially if your pup's got a sensitive stomach. It's like they're keeping it healthy while still making it taste like a cheat day treat.Now, the dental aspect? Spot on. They're tough enough to give those chompers a good workout, helping to keep the tartar and plaque in check. It's like a gym session for their teeth, but way more fun.The size of the sticks is perfect for larger senior dogs. They’re substantial enough to keep them occupied but not too huge. It's like the perfect portion for a good munch without going overboard.And the bag? It's a decent size, meaning you're not running out after just a few treat sessions. It’s like having a ready stash of doggo happiness in your cupboard."

The smell isn't strong to my nose and they're not too hard or too soft something my senior (almost 12yr) dog can chew on. She isn't a large dog so I do snap them in half and they're perfect size for her.
B0CJZ69YMK,vunderstuff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, dogs love them","Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023","I have bought the other varieties of Get Naked dental treats many times but this is the first time I have seen the senior large versions. The company uses very good ingredients including Dried potatoes, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, potato starch, chicken, natural chicken flavor, flaxseed, green lipped mussel, turmeric, cranberry fiber, calcium carbonate, parsley, l-ascorbyl-2 polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), chia seed, citric acid (preservative), fish oil (source of DHA). The large versions are about twice the size of the small version and suitable for my biggest dog or I could break them in half for my smaller guys.All of my dogs love these. They get either one or 1/2 a day depending on their size. They line up for one for their midmorning snack and can't wait to get them. Even my picky eater loves them. They are made in the US and I feel safe giving them to my dogs."
B0CJZ69YMK,Danni,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very hard,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2023","My dog seems to like the flavor of these sticks but it takes him forever to finish one because they are so hard. He likes to take his ""treats"" to his crate and chew on them there but he took one stick to his crate and gnawed on it for awhile, then lost interest and left it in his crate. I did notice he went back to it after awhile but normally he'll be in the crate until it is all gone. I suppose in one way that is good because it lasts awhile but on the opposite side of that, I do not want treats left in his crate. Overall, it just seems too hard for most dogs to chew on it."
B0CJZ69YMK,Loblady,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too Hard for My Dogs,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2023","I’m always looking for grain free treats for my two rescues. I knew these sticks were large (about 6 inches each) but I figured I’d cut it in half and they could share one. Nope. I tried breaking it in two. My husband tried breaking it. We then tried cutting it. We could not cut it in half! So, I decided to let them each have one for a taste test. After a few minutes of gnawing, my old dog gave up and walked away. A few minutes later, my other dog yelped and dropped the stick. I think the hard ridge at the edge hit his gums causing pain so I took his away also. I’m giving two stars for ingredients and flavor but they were basically inedible by my dogs. I’d also be very careful of choking if your dog manages to bite off a small piece. A little softer and this could be a good product."

So I definitely feel thesecare a beter dental stick than others that break so easily and gone within seconds.  They do have a funky smell, but its not messy or sticky nor does it leave your couch, carpeting, ect smelly. My dogs certainty don't mind the smell. Just didn't smell like a nornal dog treat to me  (bacon,chicken peanut butter ect), but I'm not the one eating it. In this particular one there are only 7 sticks per bag.

That being said, they love their dental treats, and they last a bit longer than other ones on the market. I like how they’re made for senior dogs, but they still have a lot of chew to them.These definitely are not a long lasting treat, they last on average as much as anything else I’ve fed."

What I appreciate most is that these dental sticks are grain-free, which aligns with my dog's dietary needs. Additionally, they are designed to support senior dogs' dental health, which is crucial as they age.The 6.6-ounce bag provides a good amount of treats to last for a while, and it's a convenient way to incorporate dental care into my dog's daily routine.

He regularly eats other similar treats and chews though, so I tend to think he just doesn't like the flavor."

My 10 week old lab chewed through and ate this stick within 3 minutes of giving it to him. So if you do get these teething sticks for your pups, just be sure to watch them closely. It says 3 sticks daily for 16 to 25lb puppies, but I would not recommend that, as they are super thin and could potentially be a choking hazard. They do not have a strong smell as well."

I can’t actually give one of them a treat without giving both of them the same thing.  It seriously hurts their feelings if I try.So, the 12-year-old thoroughly enjoys these puppy treats also. :)This is a great price when you buy them in a three pack.

She is very hyperactive and bitey probably due to her teething, which has curbed her desire to bite everything within sight. If you have a bitey puppy, keep one of these on hand to have them chew on. In my opinion, they are a bit small, quite soft, and bendable. Because of that I always make sure to supervise my puppy while she's chewing on it just in case. It seems to last her a good amount, 1 per day for a 2-pound puppy. The recommendation on the back feels spot on so follow it."

After that I decided to buy them for my dog (he's a Lahsa Apso), and he really loved them and this brand in general. I buy him these, the ones for a healthy coat, and the digestive health sticks."

We had to stop giving her anything made of rawhide or bone years ago, because she would swallow the treat in large chunks.  We found this product years ago and they have helped to keep her teeth.  In fact, her regularly veterinarian has been very pleased by how nice her teeth looked.  She celebrated her 13th birthday this year, and it was the first time the vet has recommended that she have plaque removed from her teeth.  A good diet and these dog chews have really helped to keep her teeth in great shape."

B08S6MQZVV,Memory lane,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smaller and softer treats for smaller/older dogs,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2021","We got these because our 15 year old chihuahua is very healthy for her age, but not able to eat anything hard because of some dental issues.We figured if she can get these down, they help her nutritionally, and make her happy, that would be a huge win.Regarding how she took to them...At first, she didn't eat these treats at all, but she is very fussy about food in general.Leaving a few near her favorite sleeping spot, she eventually decided she could deign to eat them as a snack.If you have a dog who is very into treats, I suspect they will gobble these up without hesitation.The treats themselves are: covered with some sort of yellow powder; they are quite small; their texture is soft, but not squishy, and though they have a scent, it is neither intense, nor unpleasant.As shown on the product page, the recommended serving is 8 to 10 treats for dogs 5 lbs and up.Whet they arrived, the treats had a best by date just over six months away, so they're not a treat you can keep on a back shelf forever.One thing I did not like is that they do not specify where these are produced.The company that sells them is based in Texas, but they do not state whether they are manufactured there, which leaves me wondering where they actually come from.Our picky lady does not eat these until she feels like it, but can manage them, even with some dental issues, so I think they are a good choice for senior dogs.She also has experienced no negative side effects from taking them, so that is obviously a big plus in and of itself.I would say if you are looking for a treat for an older dog that is small and easy for them to get down, this would be a good one to try."

B01JONK8VO,SE Beutel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Slightly different than the old formula....,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2016","My three dogs have been big fans of the old formula of these treats for quite a few years now. They are special favorites of my oldest dog (12) and pickiest eater. Because he is still extremely active, I try to give him as much glucosamine and chondroitin as I can. So the Get Naked Joint Health treats were a wonderful discovery. My dogs also enjoyed the other flavors in the line.When the formula was discontinued with the launch of the new grain free version, I was incredibly disappointed. Especially because the new treats had not reached the super-affordable price I was used to with the old formula (< $4) and the price on the discontinued formula was skyrocketing, which is typical of a market for a discontinued product. I was afraid that my dogs wouldn't like the new formula or that it would make them sick. I still don't understand why they needed to go grain free, considering that the grains in the old formula consisted only of rice and oats (which I didn't think were a big concern in doggie diets), but I am very glad the treats came back down to the extremely affordable price that my dogs and I love. Happily, the treats pass the doggie taste test and have yet to come back up the way they came.So without further ado, here is my comparison to the old formula for the treats:OUTSIDE: To start of, the packaging of the treats is very similar in wording and warnings, although the ingredient list does differ a bit. The package is orange instead of chartreuse, and since I don't particularly like either color it doesn't matter much that the bag got uglier. However, the development of the new packaging was clearly misguided. Perhaps in an attempt to make the packaging look like more ""natural"" products do in most marketing, the appearance of the bag has been ~softened~ to the point where things are very hard to read. Ditching the outline on the letters on the front was a big mistake with the gradient to light orange in the center, since it makes the letters look so fuzzy I thought my glasses were dirty or falling off my face. On the back, the crisp black lettering for the nutritional information was traded in for an even smaller font in white letters again. I can see that the smaller font was likely necessary because the packaging is now bilingual in English and French, but the choice of white is once again irritating to the eye. Even the NPIC logo and company information is so blurry that it is completely illegible.INSIDE: The grain ingredients, as well as tapioca starch, in the old formula have been replaced with potatoes. The rest of the ingredients listed are the same. The nutritional analysis is almost identical, with the exception that the Crude Protein minimum is 20% instead of 18%. The glucosamine per serving (32mg) and chondroitin sulfate (19mg) are the same, and now DHA is listed as well (4mg). The calorie content per treat remains at 26 kcal.The treats themselves are the same length and shape as the old formula, and have an almost identical amount of give as far as the hardness of the treat goes (which is good because the 10 year old rescue dog only has 5 teeth). They are not scary hard, but chewy enough to keep the dogs entertained for a few minutes and delicious enough to get the dogs excited when they see their favorite treat bag (which they know by shape and sound). Watching my dog chomp away, I would say that these new treats may be a bit tougher to bit through, although not too much.I was a little disappointed when I compared the new and old treats and found that the new ones are a bit slimmer than they used to be. It's not much, but considering that there were 2 less in the bag than you got in the old formula that was a bit sad. However, I noticed that the new treats are slightly heavier per piece, and the higher density makes sense with the extra chewing my toothless wonderdog was doing. The smell of the new formula is comparable to the old, slightly different but similar and nothing my dogs minded too much.If the treats continue to stay at this low price, I'll be very happy and hopefully my concerns over the formula switch will have been for nothing. I don't think I would pay more than $5 or so per bag, but that's partly because I can't afford much more right now as a pet indulgence and partly because I'm also just cheap (as much as I can be while still taking great care of my dogs). Also, I prefer to give the two older dogs at least one of these per day, since it makes them happy and gives them some extra vitamins that their little arthritic knees crave. At this price, I can do that.[...] I rely on reviews for my online purchases and want to do my part by making my reviews as helpful as I can. Thanks for reading!"

B01JONK8VO,A. Lowrey,5.0 out of 5 stars,My dogs love them,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023","They smell awful but my dogs love them. They must have changed the recipe of the other joint supplement treats - my dogs won’t eat them anymore. I can tolerate the smell and be happy knowing my old gal, who used to be very sedate, will keep all of her high-energy play, super-cuddly affection and all the other progress she’s made since introducing joint supplement treats. We didn’t even know she was in pain until she wasn’t anymore. I’ll gladly go without a few Starbucks runs to pay for these."
B01JONK8VO,Lolita,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING treats!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018","My dogs LOVEEEE THESE! One is much pickier than the other and he can’t get enough of these. They have a subtle minty/vanilla smell and they’re not super hard so older pups or ones with missing teeth would be fine with these. You can actually break them in half- they’re kinda bendy so it takes a little effort, but nothing major. I have one 15lb dog and one 20lb and I’ve gotten both chew sizes. The large ones keep them busy for a bit longer so that’s good. I love the ingredients and the price is amazing since they eat more than they probably should of these. 😬"
B01JONK8VO,SouthernAmazoner,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good dental treats with added benefits,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2017",Most dental chews for some reason contain wheat or soy.  So these are nice to have if you want to avoid those ingredients.  Glad these have supplemental ingredients to promote healthy joints as well as healthy teeth.  My dog loves these.
B01JONK8VO,Jks,5.0 out of 5 stars,My pup goes crazy for these chew sticks !!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2016","I have been buying these from a local pet store till I discovered I can purchase them from Amazon which is way more convenient and they shipped right to my house.  I love that they are low in calorie and do not contain rawhide which could cause a potential issue with my dog.  I am very cautious on the chews he is permitted to have since his health is my primary concern.  I actually have my little guy on a diet so I have been snapping these in half every night which he gets after his teeth brushing.  Every night he waits in the bathroom for me to wash my face and he patiently waits his turn to get his teeth brushed.  Yes that is correct I brush his teeth every single night before we go to bed and his reward is half of one of these chew sticks.  I never before have seen this brand in the local pet stores, I love the variety I am able to find on Amazons site I wanted these in particular since my pup has 2 grade 3 patellas anything that is good for his joints I will buy for him to help him stay healthy.  I love that these are manufactured in the USA.  It is wonderful that I have a low cal healthy option for my little guy and he absolutely loves them."
B01JONK8VO,Kimberly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great dog chews,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2023","I love this brand of chews for my tiny poodle mix. I like that they are easy to snap in half if i dont want to give her a whole one and the added benefit of glucosamine is a plus for me. My dog is only 8lbs but very active, and i hope to keep her that way as long as i can"
B01JONK8VO,Hauservi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dogs love these chews,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2022",I wouldn't buy this if you are looking for longevity...

B01JONK8VO,Emilie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pups love these low cal treats,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020","Chubby pups needed a change in their treats, and I was lucky to find these little sticks. My dogs make short work of them, but that's enough time for me to get out of the house and make my escape with them distracted, chomping away. I purchased these in different flavors, which I cannot attest to, but they like all the flavors.It's amazing how many calories are in dog treats, and if you give your pup several treats a day, the pounds can really pack on quickly. I'm glad these are relatively low calorie so i can reward the pupsters several times a day."

We break them in half and she still gets enough of a challenge to let us do what we need to do while she can munch away happily!"
B01JONK8VO,Andrea,5.0 out of 5 stars,My dogs love these.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2019","My favorite thing about these treats are how clean they are. With other treats, there’s crumbs and sticky residues that get everywhere. I never find anything after giving these to my dogs. They have a minty scent that lingers, and I’m sure the shape helps clean their teeth. I can’t speak for the claims they make for joint health, but my dogs definitely love these. They’ve never had an upset stomach after eating them, but will have problems with other well known dental chews."

Along with other treatment, I gave her one in the morning and one at night. Gotta say, she loves them. It seemed to help her joint a little bit. Not saying this is a miracle maker, but it's a nice extra source of glucosamine to help support weak joints. Especially considering weeks ago she could hardly stand on her own."

We call it BT (breath treats) and give them each one every time we leave the house. They know to wait for it and each go about their way to chew on it. They are hard treats and it takes them a few minutes to eat them. I like the joint support because one of my dogs has back problems. They don't have a particularly strong smell which is unusual for dog treats. I always wait to find a good price and then stock up!"

My 15lb miniature schnauzer has refused to eat dinner unless she can get one of these sticks as an appetizer. There have been times when fights have broken out between the other boys over finishing any bits that are being slowly being savored.There is one of the bunch who is a chihuahua/yorkie/pom mix. He typically gets half a stick (easily broken in half), and that is satisfying enough for him."
