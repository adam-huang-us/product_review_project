They do not last more than A MINUTE or TWO (maybe 2 with my puppy, but definitely less than 1 minute for my 7 year old husky shepherd mix).These are ""small"" and there are about 16-18 sticks per bag, so they are a good alternative (only about 27 calories per stick) for my puppy as my older dog gets his Bark Bright stick every morning.

I also really love that they are helping to provide my girl with the proper nutrients she needs while developing. They are a bit small, however, for a growing large breed puppy and, expensive when you factor in that you should be feeding them to your dog twice a day.

For my puppy, I like that she's getting her teeth cleaned while giving me 20 minutes of respite from her antics. Nice to see her chomp on something other than my bum or ankles :). Yay! My senior dog with missing teeth takes about 40 minutes, but she looks forward to it every day. We're happy when she's happy!
