I think she likes the chicken flavor of these treats, and I like how they contain probiotics and colostrum for gut health and improved immunity.The list of ingredients in these treats is mercifully short, indicating there isn’t a lot of processed junk. Though I wouldn’t say these treats are Sally’s favorite of all time, she does like getting them, and again, I like their small size and minimal calories. I can definitely see how these treats would be good for training puppies.

So we've been looking for some treats that will get him to focus when we're out so we can reinforce the basics.For a food driven puppy he's very particular about treats (probably because he gets hot dogs all the time!) But as soon as I opened the bag, he was engaged. These are a soft chew and don't give off a lot of mess on your hands or your pocket and they're small enough that they are a good reward without taking too long for them to chomp down before the next repetition.I think for the price and the quality these are a great treat to keep your little ones focused on the task at hand an learning.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Training-Treats-Chicken-Recipe%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB0924YY8HC%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhPAxb7Cib6mgPH8vwOiCKf2qMito5KlOZsNVrEhbqUiZAAAAAGXT35IAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2OJFDPQ5RGC3S&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Report","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPAxb7Cib6mgPH8vwOiCKf2qMito5KlOZsNVrEhbqUiZAAAAAGXT35IAAAAB&reviewId=R2OJFDPQ5RGC3S",""

I think she likes the chicken flavor of these treats, and I like how they contain probiotics and colostrum for gut health and improved immunity.The list of ingredients in these treats is mercifully short, indicating there isn’t a lot of processed junk. Though I wouldn’t say these treats are Sally’s favorite of all time, she does like getting them, and again, I like their small size and minimal calories. I can definitely see how these treats would be good for training puppies. They seem moist and are not too soft, not too hard.These treats do not contain corn, soy, or wheat.","One person found this helpful","Report","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FN-Bone-Training-Treats-Chicken-Recipe%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB0924YY8HC%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhGsuJt3ycnqf9E9n07Rjam6jPhP1%252BVQ716%252FTZndgdjtvAAAAAGXT35IAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1IXN4KBDO4CA7&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","Showing  comments","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hGsuJt3ycnqf9E9n07Rjam6jPhP1%2BVQ716%2FTZndgdjtvAAAAAGXT35IAAAAB&reviewId=R1IXN4KBDO4CA7",""
